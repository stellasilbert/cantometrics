Eaeh tribe has its own particular tuning for these keys, sliding them in or out to vary the pitch. Originally the keys were made of bamboo, but today old umbrella stays are found to be more convenient, and require little hammering out.

Like many of his tribe, Abdul Aziz sings in a quiet falsetto. His joy in the music lies mainly in his skill with the lukembi. He shakes his head from side to side as he sings :

""Ah me! I've lost my wife, and don't
know where to find her."" Then, after a
miniature cadenza on the lukembi:
""Alas, alas, and now I've lost my hen. ""

This is typical of the plaintive little song you might hear in any Ituri village, as the player lolls back in a chair on his veranda, gazing up at the sky, the lukembi held loosely between his knees. Lukembis are also used when walking from one village to another. Known by many different names elsewhere (the best known perhaps being sansa) this instrument is probably the most common of all musical instruments south of the Sahara. The number of keys and the tuning varies from tribe to tribe, as does the construction. Instead of the box construction described above, the keys may be fitted to a flat board which inturn may be placed in a calabash to add resonance."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

This particular song is one of their religious songs, where children and women are also take part. However, it is not an accepted practice amongst more orthodox Muslims. The drum, that's used during this perofmance, is the small box drum found among the Arabs, played with the fingers and palms. In most of the Aribise songs, the ritual grunting is a feature and it can be heard quite plainly in this recording. Musafili's sub-chief starts the song, then Musafili takes over and the solo alternates between the two of them. In the background, crickets and a brewing thunderstorm could be heard. (Colin M.

251,2.72,30.64,,,21132,,0:04:02,4A22.A6,Dance Music,Dance Song,"""While this is a typical Pygmy dance, it is only typical of pygmies when they are down in the non-Pygmy village, in an act of showmanship. Their dancing in the forest is equally fine, in many respects a great deal finer, but it is accompanied only by song, sticks and handclaps. In the village they borrow drums, clappers and a mgungu gong. 

A steady stick beat that never falters through the dance starts the music. The ""birds"" in the background are in fact Pygmies. The mgungu, drums and voices corne in together and the dance begins with little delay. The hooting sound which could be mistaken for horns is also made by Pygmies. They form a circle, women facing men. They hoot a chorus, with snatches of solo being passed from one to another, singing encouragement as each dancer leaps into the center and performs in turn. The dancing is a game between feet and drum, the drum leading the feet for a while, then the dancer suddenly syncopating his step and making the drum follow him. After displaying his virtuosity as a dancer he jigs along the line of girls and eventually leads one out into the center for a brisk whirl. Both return to their places and another couple takes the floor. As dancers the Pygmies are inexhaustible. Dancing by firelight into the early hours of the morning, they truly earn the title given them by the ancient Egyptians: The Dancers of God."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

A Hunting Song can be distinguished by scale and technique from a Honey Song, or from the songs of the Elima or the Molima - the religious societies of women and men. 

Hunting songs may be sung when setting out in the morning, but more often in the evening, after a meal around the camp fire. The men all eat together while the women and children eat outside their beehive-shaped huts. The forest all around is dark and silent, except for the crickets and frogs, and an occasional distant growl of some animal looking for a meal. The circular camp is lit by a large fire in the center, and a number of smaller fires, one outside each hut. The group of men in the center are the main singers, but sometimes the solo or even the chorus is passed around the circle of huts in canon form - one group taking over a measure before the other finishes. Clapped sticks are used for accompaniment -- either split at the end, or unsplit -- giving a harder, hollow sound. 

In this elephant-hunting song split sticks are used to mark the time, and only the group of men and boys around the main fire sing. A couple of chords start them off, but then there is, as usual, a long warming-up period. The solo is taken up by two young hunters, overlapping, taking over from each other the story of the hunt. The chorus, very hesitant and uncertain to begin with, slowly gets under way, using the peculiar hooting technique in which each singer has one particular note which he hoots at the appropriate moment. Sometimes a singer will have two notes, and in this way a harmonic as well as a melodic pattern is passed around the circle. 

As the chorus takes shape the soloist tells his simple story, occasionally breaking off to tell the others that they are putting up a pretty poor show, and he stands up ana begins to dance. The chorus and the split stick continue without change now, and the soloist, instead of singing, dances in the firelight and mimes the story of the elephant hunt. He ends this act with a series of yodels of satisfaction."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

There is of course the slit log or ""talking drum,"" which simulates words of the Topoke language.

The voice is also used to imitate signal horns and flutes. This is very intriguing, as it is a situation where the voice is imitating an instrument imitating the voice.

(a) SIGNALLING ON SLIT LOG DRUM

(b) SIGNALLING WITH THE VOICE:

Topoke is a two-tone language. The two tones emitted by the voice here, like the two tones produced on the slit log drum, are translated by the listener back into words. In this recording a man calls into the forest and is answered by a second man.

(c) HORN SIGNALLING:

Two men signal back and forth on ivory horns.

(d) MOUTH SIGNALLING IN IMITATION OF TRUMPET:

The voice is projected through a sound chamber formed by the hands.

(e) MOUTH SIGNALLING IN IMITATION OF FLUTE:

Here, too, the tone is controlled by using the hands as a sound chamber.

While the island is primarily influenced from the Oceanic side, the Arabic imprint is also strong, as is the African as well in certain areas. This particular Mahafaly song is sung by a single strong and thready male voice, accompanied by a harp or lyre and what appear to be rhythm sticks. The singer sings a fairly extended series of melodic phrases which occupy usually some 10 to 12 beats, and tben allows the harp or lyre G to 8 beats. The instrument is played in an almost never varied melodic pattern which, with the sticks, sets up a metronomic beat. The melodic accents of both voice and harp or lyre coincide, while those of the sticks fall regularly between; thus, if notation is in 4/4 meter, the stick sounds fall on the second and fourth beats of the measure.""

About 15 drummers are seated near a huge fire at which they repeatedly heat their tambor to raise the pitch. About sixty women dance in a circle around them, in a design sometimes snake-like sometimes star-shaped. The dance is repeated many times during the night; sometimes two girls dance solemnly in the center of the circle. The general pattern is as follows: 

While the drummers ""warm up"" with cascades of beats, a woman tries a melody. The other women may not respond to the first theme, if so she tries another. When the choir takes it up, the song is considered ""mature"" (Until the song is ""matured"" the women cover their mouths with their hands lest a djinn enter.) Then starts a measured 4/4 rhythm and the dancing begins. After irregular sections of odd-numbered beats, the rhythm changes to 6/8 and gradually accellerates till the lead drummer rises and twirls his drum aloft. Then there is a shout, a roll of drums and silence. The musical scales consist of the first five notes, sometimes of major, sometimes of minor.""

However, since the tendi itself is an instrument of Sudanese origin and was brought into Tuareg music individualistic of dancing, the dance is merely an embellishment to the singing and does not appear to have any ritual importance. The Tohimo Dance is supplication on behalf of a person taken over by the devil and shows the curious mixture of animism and anthropomorphism that is the foundation of Tuareg religious belief.

It is a dance performed only a few times each year and only then, apparently, due to a spontaneous feeling engendered by a gathering of the three factions of the oasis: Tuareg, Arab and African. Each of these is involved: the Tuareg women provide the singing and the terelilit; the Africans (Harratin) the dance and a mesmeric chanting that ultimately dominates; and the Arabs, as spectators, form the circle around the dancers and participate in the hand-clapping which is the only measure of time accompanying music. 

Tazenkharet is only danced at night and, on this occasion, during the period of the full moon before the end of Ramadan. It lasts through the night, developing until a point is reached where the ecstatic solo singing of the Tuareg woman, the terelilit of her companions, the chanting and grunts of the dancers achieve a unity and emotional tension where excitement is at fever-pitch. After this point the endurance of Africa prevails, the Tuareg singing becomes submerged beneath the rising tide of the chant, the tempo increases and the dance ends ultimately from exhaustion, and from the selfinduced trance of the dancers.""

The young Tuareg men, mounted on magnificent riding camels, provide a ""quadrille of camels"", two opposing lines of warriors facing each other with the women and the tendi between them. In turn they sweep across the camp, drawing always closer to the circle in the middle and, as the excitement increases, a rider will lean from his mount at full gallop and snatch from the shoulders of one of the women her shawl. Immediately, the other mehari are in pursuit. They head him off and triumphantly return the garment to its owner to be rewarded by the terelilit, the trilling cry of the women that is the mark of admiration and joy.

The song, which is often sung at marriages, expresses the wish (deeply rooted in Saharan economy) that the men will have many fine camels, i. e. become rich.""

These songs are sung purely for entertainment and members join the group only for the love of making music. The group may perform at wake-keeping in honor and memoyr of a deceased member or one who may have been known for his interest in the group. On such occasions the performance is considered a tribute to the deceased and the bereaved. 

Accompaniment of the songs is usually handclapping. However, the use of a few idiophones and one or two drums can be noted in performances by some of the well established performance groups. The nnwomkoro songs in this selection are accompanied by handclapping, castanets, a bell (dawuro), double bell (nnawuta) and a Prenpansua (an idiophone of the Mbira or Sanza type) with three tones.

The themes of the songs are generally centered around loved ones and prominent members of the community. Even though these songs are generally described as songs of 'pleasure', the verbal contents do not always reflect a happy mood. Songs which allude to yearnings in the heart for an absent friend or lover, and songs that reflect hope or disappointment, bitterness or resignation, insult or satire can be heard at most nnwomkoro performances. The songs in this selection have texts that are meant to praise the Ashanti Kings. Nnwomkoro songs are a means of entertainment as well as a vehicle of communication - a medium of expressing personal and social experiences."" (Francis A.

Mpre is a light version of adowa music (adowa is music of a popular band which is especially created for funerals and has borrowed alot of its elements from other musical types, especially from Kete (Kete - a drum ensemble found at the courts of chiefs. It has always been the favoritensemble of Ashanti kings. The ensemble is played at royal funerals.)). It is distinguished by a relatively gentle pace. In this performance, the donno drum is used. Because it is funeral music, almost all of the themes of the songs are based on death and the havoc it delivers to individuals and the community. In one of the songs we hear the women sing: 

Death is invading my home, I cannot go to sleep. 
Wherever I go, I am sure to meet death.

The ends and middle are thinned from the bottom in varying amounts for tuning and toning. The range is, roughly, from C up two and a third octaves to E flat. Under each strip is a spherical gourd between 21/2 and 5 inches in diameter. The whole instrument is lashed together with native string on a flexible bamboo frame three feet long. The player puts his instrument on the ground in front of him and uses two sticks with rubber heads. He has rattles on each arm. 

The selection was recorded during the feast that follows the fast month - the year's most festive occasion for the Moslem Manctingo. Two balafons accompany the singing in praise of Mohammed.""

The second is a three dimensional representation of the human face, and the third (which is no longer used) is a flat, one-dimensional representation of the human face. These masks are always used in pairs, and Goli is associated with human fertility. Music is provided by a chorus of men playing beaded gourds called towa, and by a large antilope horn called goli ahoue which produces a single low note. The dancer's costume includes a dried antelope skin attached to his back and he carries a baton attached to a length of cord. During the dance this baton is swung backward to strike the antelope skin with a resounding crack. The dance is presented for social as well as ceremonial purposes, and after the god has appeared women may join the spectators to watch him dance. After the god has departed both men and women will continue the dance for several hours.""

Actually, this group of gods are neither personal nor restricted to men. Rather, they serve the whole family with the male head of the family serving as the intermediary who is charged with carrying out the ritual expected by the god. Women are frequently not permitted to see the mask and other religious paraphernalia related to these gods, but they are usually allowed to listen to the music and to take part in the dancing which is a part of the god's ritual. A distinctive sound is often a part of the Baoule concept of the god. Although this is referred to as the ""voice"" of the god, it is not used as a means of communication. This piece, which is a part of the adoration ritual for the god Kloro, starts with the ""voice"" of the god. The rite here recorded was held in combination with the funeral ceremonies for a village elder who passed away a few months previous to the recording. The ceremony began early in the morning, around 3 AM. It persisted until dawn when the mask left to its abode in the forest right prior to the village women arose. The god Kloro, in this selection, was symbolized by two masked dancers. One of the masks being a very old, one which over the many years had been almost ruined by the ravages of insects. The second mask was comparatively new, and had been newly painted a distinctive red, black and white for this ceremony. It is a two-faced mask with the open mouth of an animal at either end.

The whistles that are heard in this piece are special instruments, played by men. The playing of these whistles creates tremendous excitement, perhaps because the Anaguta consider them voices of the spirits. The whistles are very small, only a few inches in lengtn, with one or two finger holes. 

The women sway singing in a circle surrounding the dancing men, while the men play the whistles, they move in a slow, rocking manner, dancing and playing together. Each whistle player and each singer uses only one, two or three notes. Quasi-melodies are built when players and singers interlock parts in the manner that church bell melodies are often played in Europe. This technique, known as ""hocketing"", is common in many kinds of instrumental ensemble playing all around Africa. Its use in vocal groups, nevertheless, is not common, and has a very distinguished distribution. Because the Anaguta people are primitive, and acephalous, it is not surprising that all of their group singing is performed in this manner.

In this recording, there is a great deal of repetition, and the variations are solely incidental, though subtle, inflections of the basic patterns. One might call this play a ""joint"", in which one replicated piece is followed by another. It is very clear how smoothly this rotation is achieved: the second flute begins its new motive at the same time as the first flute is playing the last part of its old one.

Men and women get together and start to dance in a circle created by a row of men who sing and by a semi-circle of women who clap with wooden blocks. The drums are always played by men. The dance requirescomplex footwork that varies accordingly with changes in the drum rhythm,  and it is an energetic dance. The dancer bends slightly forward at the waist with his arms extended out on either side. A person might dance either alone or accompanied with one or a few other dancers facing him or at his side. The clapping quickly changes from a steady beat to a fast syncopated rhythm when one of the dancers comes forward and starts to dance. During the dance there is a constant exchange of kerchiefs, handkerchiefs and hats between young men and women. If a girl adores a young man, she will throw her kerchief at his feet. During his dancing he will pick it up and either return it instantly if he is not interested, or wait until the young lady herself is dancing and in turn throw it at her feet. If he wishes to make a rendez-vous with her at a later time he will keep the kerchief. The bugur can last anywhere from an hour or so in the evening to several days. 

This specific recording was made in Dakar and the occasion was a marriage. The dance took place on Saturday and Sunday between about three in the afternoon and midnight. The drummer, Jinkoly Sane, performed without relief and with only a few breaks for lemonade and later an hour of interval for dinner. He is known as the best drummer of the bugur. (J.

The theme of the Gunborg is gossip. The Songman composes the words on some passing event in social heppenings such as in love affairs, but makes the allusions indirect, so as to avoid trouble. Moreover, the words frequently have a latent meaning, usually with sexual significance.The sample of which two verses are given, states that the Songman wanted his female cousin, and that they came out (from the camp).

Cultivators often join with neighbors and family to help one another with basic tasks such as planting, weeding, or harvesting. In return their hosts provide the workers with ample food and drink. Group labor of this kind is often coordinated to the rhythms of work songs, as in the coumbite tradition of Haiti, or the digging songs of Jamaica. Like other work songs in the region, those used for cultivation vary across a spectrum from more African to more European; this selection from Anguilla displays elements of both.

This enigmatic song sounds like it was originally a tree-felling song that was later adapted to other tasks such as the preparation of fields for planting, to judge from the hoe-like sound keeping time in the background.

Anguilla is a scrubby 36-square-mile island that remains a colony of Great Britain. Virtually treeless, the island’s population includes very few farmers, Anguillans being known rather as great fishermen and boatbuilders. When Lomax recorded this song in 1962, therefore, it was likely a remnant of a bygone era, or perhaps imported from another island. According to Lomax’s notes, the cooperative labor tradition to which the song belongs was already dying there. In any case, the song’s lyrics, with their suggestion of fruit trees (or pieces of fruit?) falling down in the “master’s yard” and “Governor’s yard,” appear to exemplify the typical Caribbean practice of using work songs and other topical songs as vehicles for satirical social commentary aimed at those in positions of power.

The female song leader’s wonderfully energetic performance conveys the gusto with which cooperative labor in the Caribbean is often carried out. The pleasure of performing such songs contributes greatly to the festive atmosphere surrounding communal labor throughout the region. No wonder the name by which this custom is known in Anguilla is “jollification.”","Florence Brooks, Eugenie Carter, Louisa Carty, James A.

Some such groups have tended to intermarry infrequently with outsiders and have maintained distinctive local folk cultures of predominantly European origin. One such enclave exists on the tiny island of St. BarthÈlemy (more commonly known as St. Barts).

Located at the northern end of the Leeward Islands chain, this island has a total land area of only about ten square miles. In 1659 St. Barts received an influx of roughly a hundred French settlers, most of them from Brittany and Normandy. Although the island became Swedish in 1784, it was returned to France in 1878 and has remained a French possession ever since; today it is a dependency of Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France.

Slavery played a minor role in the colonial economy of St. Barts, and few Africans were brought to the island. Many of its 3,000 or so present-day inhabitants are descendants of the original seventeenth-century Normans and Bretons who came to the island as small farmers. Underneath a veneer of modern metropolitan French culture emanating from the island’s French political status lies an older layer of French provincial culture dating back several centuries.

The intriguing ballad featured here clearly belongs to this older layer. While the presence of old English and Irish ballads has long been acknowledged in the British West Indies, a parallel tradition of French balladry in the francophone Caribbean has gone almost entirely unnoticed; Lomax’s pioneering research in St. BarthÈlemy produced a valuable body of recordings documenting this little-known tradition. To those unaware of the Caribbean’s remarkable range of musical styles and genres, this fine example of a transplanted French ballad, with its medieval theme, sounds strangely out of place. But it demonstrates an important point: just as neo-African folk musics, under the right conditions, have been able to take root and thrive on Caribbean soil, so have purely European ones.",Manuel Magras,Male Voice,Men,"Le moine se lËve d’un grand matin pour recommencer sa semaine,

",Work Song; Boat Song; Hauling Song,"The African-influenced work songs that are found on every Caribbean island may be seen as the counterparts to the prison songs that helped to preserve the tradition of African-style work songs in the American South, so well documented by Lomax previously. Among the most important Caribbean work songs are those related to the sea – in coastal areas, fishing and boatbuilding remain important occupations. This boat-pulling song, used for hauling ashore locally made fishing boats known as pirogues, has the classic pattern of call-and-response common to work songs from both Europe and Africa. Like many Caribbean work songs, this Dominican example cannot be traced exclusively to either continent: strands from both have become inseparably interwoven into a new whole.

The words are evidence of the musical exchange between islands that has characterized the Caribbean region for centuries. The recurrent phrase “lawivyË leza,” in the chorus is also the name of a genre of dance and music associated with work songs used to accompany house- and fence-building in the northern part of Martinique, just to the south of Dominica. The exact meaning of the phrase appears to have been lost.","George Etienne, Victor Johnson, Seaford Simon, Clemence Taverner",4 Male Voices,Men,"Chorus:

Rowing songs were the first kind of African-American work song described by white travelers in the American south, and mention of them goes back to the 1820s.

Each such area has its own distinctive variants of bÈlÈ. Like the bÈlÈ of Tobago and certain parts of Trinidad, for instance, the bÈlÈ of Dominica features a large, shallow frame drum held in the hands (in Dominica called lapo-kabwit). This contrasts with the bÈlÈ traditions of Martinique, St. Lucia, Grenada, Carriacou, and some parts of Trinidad, all of which use deeper barrel drums that are either held between the legs with the player in sitting position or turned on their sides and mounted. BÈlÈ dances have taken place on holidays and festive occasions in Dominica since the slavery era. 

Today, almost two centuries after the island became an English possession, there is still abundant evidence of the older Afro-French layer of Dominica’s creole cultural heritage. This heritage is reflected, for instance, in the Madras headwear typically worn by women dancers and singers; certain dance movements and melodic turns; and the French-based Creole language of songs. The present selection offers yet another example of how neatly European and African musical concepts could be meshed in the music of the Caribbean. Yet, as thoroughly creolized as this music is, the African background remains dominant – not only in the prominent bell-like patterns played on the percussive steel rod, but also in the complex way these interlock with the rhythms of the drum.","May Elias, Carrie Belle Gervais, Vincent Gervais, Anelta Nicholas, Clemencia Nicholas, Lionel Simon",6 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

It is accompanied by a lapo-kabwit, a large, shallow frame drum held in the hands, and a tingting, a name applied to either a triangle or steel rod used as a time keeper in bélé performances. 

Perhaps stemming from the contredanse and quadrille traditions, the male dancer in bélé is called kavalyé (cavalier), and the female dancer danm (dame). As in Puerto Rican bomba, the dancers interact with the lead drummer, their steps mirroring changes in the rhythmic patterns. The chantwell (song leader) is answered by the lavwé (chorus). These names link bélé on Dominica with its relatives on Martinique, Trinidad, St. Lucia, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.","May Elias, Carrie Belle Gervais, Vincent Gervais, Anelta Nicholas, Clemencia Nicholas, Lionel Simon

Although today work songs have virtually disappeared from Dominica because of new technologies, a number of different types could still be found there when these recordings were made. These included sawing songs, axe songs, rowing songs, fruit-gathering songs, house-moving songs, boat-pulling songs, road-building songs, digging songs, and tug-of-war songs. One of the striking features of African-American work songs is the transformation of work tools into musical instruments. When coordinated activities are involved, work songs provide the rhythmic cues that govern group activity, or they may also accompany a solitary individual. Here, the steady rhythms of a saw form the underpinning of the song, giving it a polyrhythmic quality. Lomax has left us a description of this recording session: “Part of the group of the evening before met us at the saw-pit behind the blind man’s little store. The singing was all done at work, the songs being cut in accordance with the job at hand. Very hot. Men running with sweat. Lots of rum.”",Raphael Hurtault,Male Voice; Saw,Men,"Leader: Di yo, pa hele pou nou!

They have been the training ground for young girls, and to a lesser extent boys, both musically and as preparation for courtship. Caribbean play songs, like most other musical traditions in the region, have multiple origins; some bear an obvious African imprint, others clearly stem from European sources, while yet others fall somewhere in between.

This apparently simple children’s song has a complex history. A courtship drama, it resembles the ancient British song game “Three Knights from Spain,” which originated in the medieval courts of France and Italy, then spread to Great Britain, from where, in the nineteenth century, it traveled to the Caribbean and the United States. During World War II it returned to Great Britain via U.S. Air Force personnel and immigrant West Indian families.",Chorus of children,Children's Voices,Mixed children,"Mine is the prettiest –

Like their counterparts elsewhere in the region, jing-ping bands specialize in creolized versions of European dances such as the quadrille, mazurka (mazouk), and polka; some of them have also adopted and refashioned trans-Caribbean popular styles such as the mÈringue/merengue.

A typical jing-ping band features accordion; a large frame drum known as tamboo, tambal, or lapo-kabwit; a scraped percussion instrument known as syak, or gwaj (grage); a rattle known as chac-chac; a bass wind instrument made of bamboo (or more recently, the exhaust pipe of a car), called boom pipe or boom-boom; and sometimes other percussion. 
Occasionally a banjo or guitar also appears.

In this fine example of a jing-ping performance, a song with mixed English and French Creole lyrics is backed by an indigenized mÈringue rhythm. The staggered entry of the instruments at the beginning – the way they gradually come in one after the other, creating multiple layers – is but one of the many ways in which a fundamentally African (and Afro-American) aesthetic shines through in this piece.

Jing-ping music exerted an important influence on the popular cadence-lypso style that developed in Dominica in the 1970s, which in turn fed into the zouk music that exploded onto the French Antillean and Parisian pop music scenes in the early 1980s.","Oliver Andrew, boom pipe, Cecil Austrie, palito, Everard DeJean, lead vocal and accordion, Augustus Edward, tamboo drum, Raymond Giraudel, chac-chac",Male Voice; Boom Pipe; Palito; Accordion; Tamboo Drum; Chac-Chac,Men,"No more love for you again, oh

In one form or another, kalinda, like bÈlÈ, appears to have spread to virtually all those parts of the Caribbean either formerly under French control or significantly affected by the French slave trade. Afro-creole dances called kalinda (kalenda, calenda, etc.) are known to have existed in previous centuries in places as far removed from each other as Louisiana and Trinidad. 

Nowhere has a music-and-dance genre bearing this name left a more significant mark than in Trinidad, where kalinda stickfighting competitions – part of an African-influenced martial-art tradition with its own drumming and singing – were early on incorporated into Carnival and contributed significantly to the development of calypso. Yet despite its historical importance, kalinda is no longer a major part of Carnival in Trinidad, where stickfighting and drumming in general were repeatedly suppressed by British authorities as threatening to the social order. The dance and associated stickfighting tradition remain a vital part of the local Carnival in Carriacou, however, where it has also been incorporated into the Big Drum repertoire, a circumstance that undoubtedly has helped keep it alive. One theory even maintains that kalinda may even have been brought to Trinidad in the first place by migrating Carriacouans in the nineteenth century.

However that may be, the kalinda traditions of the two islands have continued to influence each other into this century. As a result, two kinds of kalinda are now played in Carriacou – an older variety, considered indigenous to the island, and a newer style, said to have been introduced to Carriacou by migrants returning from Trinidad. The association of kalinda with Carnival and stickfighting is apparent in the French Creole lyrics of the present selection, which beseech a police officer, Corporal Williams, to let the singer go, at least until Carnival is over. 

Lomax was told that this song is a “man kalinda,” meaning that it is one of the old, original kalindas traditional to Carriacou. Yet the theme of this song is very similar to that of the tamboo bamboo song from Trinidad. (In Trinidad the British also attempted to suppress the tamboo bamboo bands, which, like the kalinda drums, were sometimes used to provide music for stickfighting.)","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Larena Clement, May Fortune, Mannie James, Caddy Lazarus John, Jemina Joseph, Beatrice Lazarus, Tida Lazarus, Mrs. Silvisa, Matilda Noel",Male Voice; 4 Female Voices; 8 Mixed Voices; 2 Boula; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

Among the most interesting components of this culture is a neo-African dance-drumming tradition known as Big Drum. Some of the most African music found in all of the Americas has been preserved in the “nation dances” that form the heart of the Big Drum repertoire. As in certain other parts of the New World, such as Brazil, Haiti, and Cuba, and as among the Maroons of Jamaica, a number of dance and music genres in Carriacou have maintained an explicit association with African “nations” from which the ancestors were drawn during the slavery era. 

Among the better-known nations remembered by name in Carriacou are Cromanti, Ibo, Manding, Arada, Temne, Moko, Congo, Chamba, and Banda – each of which has its own songs, rhythms and dance style. Some of these are names of historic places that played an important role in the African slave trade; others are broad ethnolinguistic labels encompassing a variety of African peoples living in the same region.

The nation dances of the Big Drum complex have traditionally played a vital role in Carriacouan social life, maintaining a link between the ancestors and the living – one of the main reasons for holding such dances being to honor these ancestors – and articulating relations between contemporary family groupings. (In addition to its African musical heritage, Carriacou is almost unique in the Caribbean in that its society once featured unilineal descent groups similar in their outlines to those found in many parts of Africa.)

The song heard here belongs to the Arada nation, which refers to ancestors brought from the general region of Dahomey, centered in what is today the Republic of Benin, most of whom were Fon, Ewe, or Mahi. The local name for this nation, Arada, is derived from Ardra (or Allada), an important Dahomean city during the era of the slave trade. Some parallels are Rada in Haiti and Trinidad and Arar· in Cuba, which refer to Dahomean-related social-religious categories and associated music and dance genres in those three islands. In Brazil, on the other hand, the corresponding Dahomean “nations” are known as GÍgÍ or Mina, and among Jamaican and Surinamese Maroons, as Papa.

The West African background of the music in this selection is particularly clearly revealed in the rapid-tempo compound duple meter drumming, the primary pulse of which is divided into triplets. According to an informant of anthropologist Donald Hill, this song is about an individual named Derrick, who was “lost in the high woods”; the singer resolves to find him.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Larena Clement, May Fortune, lead singer, Mannie James, Caddy Lazarus John, Jemina Joseph, Beatrice Lazarus, Tida Lazarus, Mrs. Silvisa, Matilda Noel",Male Voice; 4 Female Voices; 8 Mixed Voices; 2 Boula; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Djerika, ay papa,

Such all-night ceremonies typically feature Protestant hymns known as sankeys, as well as spiritual songs with a more clearly local flavor called anthems. The style of singing used at these wakes has been influenced by the Spiritual Baptist tradition of Trinidad and bears a clear resemblance to the Afro-Protestant singing heard at wakes in that island and in other parts of the former British Caribbean such as Jamaica, which has a similar nine-night tradition. 

Underlying the European-sounding melody and biblical theme of this Carriacouan anthem is a fundamentally Afro-Caribbean performance style manifested not only in the short, antiphonal repeating chorus but also in the improvisational use of vocables and other rhythmic vocalizations to create a complex, communal weave of interlocking parts.","Daniel Aikens, Phina Boatswain, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Mrs. Jean Pierre, Joseph Jerome, Sheret Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Theresa Lazarus, Derrick Lejen, James Newton, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 21 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

Although many songs in this category have an African flavor, others clearly draw on European traditions. The British Caribbean in particular is known as a rich repository for old sea chanteys. This launching song from Carriacou appears to be derived in part from one such chantey, known to collectors as “A Long Time Ago” or “In ’Frisco Bay.” This chantey, which was very popular on English and American ships during the nineteenth century, was originally a halyard song, used for hoisting or lowering sails. In Carriacou, however, it is used for very different purposes, such as launching schooners or honoring deceased sailors at wakes. 

Whereas many versions of “A Long Time Ago” make mention of ’Frisco Bay, this one refers to “Mobile Bay,” which would seem to lend support to those who have argued that West Indian workers and sailors played a major role in the development of British and American chanteying. (Mobile, Alabama, was an important cotton-trading center and one of the bustling American seaports where West Indian sailors and those from other nations met, caroused, and exchanged songs during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.) Although the singing style of the launching song heard here resembles that of British or American chanteymen, Carriacouan sailors use the song to honor the spirits of deceased friends and relatives, thus investing it with a new meaning that faithfully reflects the religious concepts of their African ancestors.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Charles Bristol, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Newton Joseph, Sheraf Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Derrick Lejen, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 18 Mixed Voices,Men,"Solo: Long time was a very good time.

The inhabitants are thought to be descended from Afro-Scottish and Afro-French boat builders and sailors, and to this day they have a reputation as fine seamen. But in the Carriacouan sense of the word, they are considered “selfish” and standoffish: they are averse to people visiting their island and even object to the police to removing troublemakers, preferring to handle matters themselves.

Carriacouans told stories about their fiercely independent neighbors. For instance there was one about a murder that took place in the ’60s on a sloop plying between Carriacou and Grenada with three Petit Martinican sailors on board. A fight broke out between two of them and one fell overboard. The third sailor tried to help him clamber back on board, but his assailant, still in a passion, pushed him back and he drowned. After arriving in Grenada, the alleged murderer was detained. People said he got a good lawyer who had him released on bail. It was rumored that the bail money involved some bobul (bribe). He returned to Petit Martinique, but the other crewman, feeling he should stand trial for murder, was able to get the case reopened. A Grenadian policeman stationed in Carriacou was sent to Petit Martinique to bring the accused back to St. George’s, Grenada, for trial. When the policeman arrived at the Petit Martinique jetty, he noticed people nearby digging. When he asked them what they were doing, they said they were digging a grave for him if he stepped off the boat. The policeman turned back and told his superiors in Carriacou that he could not pick the man up. They said that if he did not, he would be fired. He refused, was fired, and eventually migrated to England. When no one could be found to bring in the accused, the case was dropped.

In a second version of this story, the accused sailor was released because his family put up bail legitimately. Subsequently, several policemen were asked to pick him up. Not wanting to go to Petit Martinique, they cooked up a story that there was mail awaiting him in Hillsborough, Carriacou. When he came to get his mail, he was captured and taken to Grenada for trial. Again, his family made bail, and he returned to Petit Martinique. But this time when the police tried to take him off the island they were met by residents toting shotguns and pistols and the police had to retreat emptyhanded. The police decided to have the matter, rather than themselves, laid to rest.

For what it is worth, I found the Petit Martinicans to be quite friendly. Furthermore, Petit Martinicans do quite well when they migrate. One district officer (the “mayor”) in Carriacou was from Petit Martinique, as was Carriacou’s most prominent resident in Brooklyn, a medical doctor whose daughter was briefly a television actress.

“Humble-o” explains how Petit Martinicans acquired their singular character. A psychiatrist would have a field day interpreting it. It tells of a pregnant but unmarried girl from Petit Martinique and her babies, a twin girl and boy, who in turn were the progenitors of all subsequent Petit Martinican people. The Church teaching that unmarried women should not have children is reinforced when the girl is refused confirmation in Carricacou, while all the other children from Petit Martinique are eaten by Job Lutins (the devil)! Such stories, told with tongue in cheek, are meant as lessons for children.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Charles Bristol, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Newton Joseph, Sheraf Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Derrick Lejen, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 10+ Mixed Voices; 2 Boulas; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Beginning song :

Humble oh, where is she?
Quick, we have to go, quick!
We’re going.
We want to go. [Etc.]

Well that was a lady have a daughter,
And confirmation will be taking place;
That lady live in Petit Martinique, Carriacou;
And that confirmation will be taking place in Carriacou
Because Petit Martinique have no church in those time.

Well, that poor lady leave the daughter home
And come down to make right to sew a-clothes
There was no seamstress in, um —- (Listeners: Petit Martinique!)
Petit Martinique. Let me one talk!

And when she come now the day appear
That all children will come down from Petit Martinique
To come to Carriacou to land in Jean-Pierre Bay
To go down town to receive confirmation
In the Roman Catholic Church.

Well, the first boat arrive; the daughter did not come.
She wait for the second boat; the daughter did not come.

(Song)

Spoken: Krik!  
Listeners: Krak!

At that time that girl prove in family way
And you can’t confirm if you conceive with a child.
She can’t come.

The poor mother don’t know;
The poor mother don’t know if she conceive;
But she go and make all preparations before,
And then expecting her with the boat.

So when the last boat come,
And she ain’ see the daughter,
She take off her kerchief round she head,
And tie she waist and she start to bawl.

(Song)

Spoken: Krik!  
Listeners: Krak!

Well in those time —  in that time,
The daughter did not come on that direction at all.
She ain’t come with the boat,
Because she know that she conceive with a baby.

Well, the last boat come;
The lady did not see.

Well you know, at those time
We don’t have car in Carriacou to take them to town —
They have to walk.
All the candidates form together
And stepping downtown.

Well, when they meet they going down,
They going and pass Belvedere Cross,
Going downtown,
Going to the Roman Catholic Church
To get confirmation.
Bishop is there waiting.

Well, when they going to cross.
You know the road was by Noblaki [?] Bay
And crossing there,
There have a salt-pond there.

There is a man there will take away all —
Will swallow all the children,
All, everybody that pass.

Look here!
As soon as they go to cross
That lagoon 
(Listener: Salt pond!)
 — salt pond,
All gone!
They take away all!

And is only that one girl,
That stay in Petit Martinique;
And that girl come,
And she bring a twin,
A boy and a girl.

That is the onliest people 
That remain in Petit Martinique.

And all the people that leave
To go and see confirmation,
All was swallow by the —
By that man — I forget that man name.

Listeners: He name is Djabloten — The Devil!

Well, all right, no confirmation.
Nobody in Petit Martinique did not confirm
On that day because they all gone,
They did not reach town.

And that girl remain in Petit Martinique.
She make twin, and
They grow up in Petit Martinique.
And you see,
Petit Martinique is one family.

Because if anything wrong in Petit Martinique,
You go there you get dead, because —
And if you get dead there,
No one would not say:
“Well, me kill this man,”
Because they all is one.
You stranger have to keep off.

You see?

That is why, you see,
If you have a daughter, she going to confirm
And she conceive,
She can never go to the Bishop to confirm,
Because she conceive with baby.

Not so you know,
But in the way going — 
She was a candidate
In the way going to confirm,
She get the baby.
And then she remain there.

Is thanks of she that make Petit Martinique green up today.

Krik!   Krak!

Although many songs in this category have an African flavor, others clearly draw on European traditions. The British Caribbean in particular is known as a rich repository for old sea chanteys. This launching song from Carriacou appears to be derived in part from one such chantey, known to collectors as “A Long Time Ago” or “In ’Frisco Bay.” This chantey, which was very popular on English and American ships during the nineteenth century, was originally a halyard song, used for hoisting or lowering sails. In Carriacou, however, it is used for very different purposes, such as launching schooners or honoring deceased sailors at wakes. 

Whereas many versions of “A Long Time Ago” make mention of ’Frisco Bay, this one refers to “Mobile Bay,” which would seem to lend support to those who have argued that West Indian workers and sailors played a major role in the development of British and American chanteying. (Mobile, Alabama, was an important cotton-trading center and one of the bustling American seaports where West Indian sailors and those from other nations met, caroused, and exchanged songs during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.)  

Although the singing style of the launching song heard here resembles that of British or American chanteymen, Carriacouan sailors use the song to honor the spirits of deceased friends and relatives, thus investing it with a new meaning that faithfully reflects the religious concepts of their African ancestors.","Willie Alexander, Sonnel Allert, Clyde Anjou, Charles Bristol, Canute Caliste, Lenus George, Conrad Joseph, Gorine Joseph, Kingston Joseph, Matteson Joseph, Newton Joseph, Sidney Joseph, Alan Lomax, Avoide Sylvester.

The style of drumming heard in this Grenadian selection is similar to Trinidadian kalinda drumming. In both Trinidad and Grenada, kalinda was closely associated with stick-fighting, and was incorporated into Carnival early on. In Grenada, it was also used to accompany a variety of other games. The day Lomax made this recording, the performers decided to use the occasion to play a “chicken game.” His brief notes convey the exuberance of the performance:

Sunny Sunday afternoon. Village green. A little meadow beside a country road. A tree at one end. A crowd of fifty people gathered for amusement. The drums are going. A cock lies in the grass. A game is being organized for which the cock is the prize. A green stalk of banana is buried with about two inches showing above the grass. The player is blindfolded carefully and led 30 yards away down the slope. He has a long stick in his hands. When the drums begin, he starts to dance, kalinda style, and capers his way toward the drums, guiding himself by sound and by what his bare feet can make out of the terrain. He has only one chance at the simulated cock’s head. When he feels sure he has found the spot, he sweeps across the grass with his stick, as if to knock off the cock’s head. The young fellows bragged mightily, paid their dollars, missed [by] a mile. A couple of the older men won every try. Laughter. Joy.","George Hille, boula, Ralph Mitchell, coupé",2 Males; Boula; Coupé,Men,"Smoke, smoke, fire brigade.

The Shango religion of Grenada (known locally as “African work”) is thought to date back to 1849, when some 1,000 Ijesha Yoruba indentured laborers arrived in that island from Nigeria. These post-emancipation immigrants formed close-knit communities in their new island home, where they were able to maintain a strongly Yoruba-based religion and musical tradition. Over time this religion spread to other parts of the island, in the process taking on elements of Christianity. Today it is the main neo-African form of worship in Grenada. Unlike its better-known Trinidadian counterpart, from which it differs in several ways, musically and otherwise, Grenadian Shango remains poorly documented – making these early recordings by Lomax all the more noteworthy.

This song is for Ogun, the Yoruba god of war and metal working. The intricate drumming, the melody exchanged between leader and chorus (in the Yoruba language, though only partly understood by the singers), and the rhythms of the boli, a large rattle made from a gourd covered with beads, are as African in form and style as any music to be found in the Americas. (Similar beaded rattles associated with other New World, Yoruba-based religions include the Cuban g¸iro used in SanterÌa and the Afro-Bahian afoxÈ.) 
The sound of the women’s chorus is reminiscent of Bahian CandomblÈ, one of whose “nations,” Ijex·, comes from the same region of Nigeria as Grenadian Shango, as does the Iyes· style of Cuban SanterÌa.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell, drums, rattle",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,,Alan Lomax with Anna Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

1430,12.22,-61.61,,,16138,,0:02:36,T1220.8,Bring Me Water For Lily,Shango Song,"“Bring Me Water for Lilly” is perhaps the most complex song in this collection, in terms of form and meaning. Just as Catholicism, Protestantism, and Yoruba religion have been syncretized to various degrees on Grenada, so have languages. This song is a perfect illustration of the interplay of the three languages on Grenada: French Creole, English, and Yoruba.

Warner-Lewis’s interpretation is as follows: “[This song] is an intriguing instance of a Yoruba song in the transition stage of becoming an English and French Creole one. (Ma) in the first stanza could represent mother, or Yoruba maa (I will), also expressed as English Creole (‘I go’), as in the last line of the first stanza. In the second stanza, the French Creole word for first person, mwe, substitutes for Yoruba first person, mo. The congruence of sound between Lilly, the female name, and Yoruba ile/ule (house) is a further aspect of semantic shift from a Yoruban context to a Caribbean one.

“The context is problematic: As a sacred song, it appears to assert the spiritual authority of the I-persona who knows the rituals of the ‘ile awo’ or house of mysteries: the shrine. Water would form part of such rituals, and ceremonies for Lilly would require the use of water. The Yoruba word ewo is a caution to avoid a particular place and is used when water, ritual or otherwise, is being thrown. But the word here may also contain a veiled threat against those who order the life of the abused I-persona. The change in the second stanza to awo (spiritual secret), if intentional, suggests a sacred reading of ile/ule (house). Or the initial Ma may refer to a water goddess, such as Yemoja, who is being supplicated to bring her waves to take away the food offerings made by Lilly and left on the shoreline. The song may be a secular one, or it may be a sacred song transitioning to a secular theme, in which relations between servant or slave and master or mistress are being exposed. Such an interpretation is supported by the self-referent ‘nigger,’ which was normative in the plantation and colonial eras.”

In the original sequence as recorded by Lomax, a song to Shango comes just before the one below to Dada, which immediately precedes a possession. The singer of “Bring Me Water for Lilly” may have sensed that a possession was imminent, and this song may contain yet another veiled allusion to that event.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,"Ma, bring the water for Lilly.

“Dada is the mythical King of Oyo who abdicated in favor of his brother Shango. Dada was famous for his matted and curly hair; hence, he is the patron god of children born with such hair.”

Immediately after this song, the drumming stopped — there had been a spirit possession during the ceremony. Since Shango is invoked in Grenada to bring rain and a good harvest, and since this song cycle may have been recorded during a Thanksgiving feast tied to the agricultural cycle, the orisha who has “come down” may very well be Shango. Dada is not usually given in lists of known orishas for Grenada, but he is the brother of Shango, and the two are often mentioned in the same song, as they are here and elsewhere in the Caribbean.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,"Se e gberin o

A maroon is a festive occasion in which those who come together to give a helping hand are rewarded with food and drink. Most maroons are held for purposes of cultivation. (In Carriacou, the term maroon has an additional sense, sometimes being used to refer to a kind of ritual feast in the Big Drum tradition.) In Grenada, work songs have traditionally played an important role in maroons, being used to coordinate various tasks and to make hard work more enjoyable. As in other parts of the Caribbean, work songs in Grenada have been drawn from diverse sources. The example that follows appears to have started out as a sea chantey.","Banfield Andall, Claudius Andall, Claude Bartholomew, Alexis George, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Simpson Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Fitz Jones, Alstead McQueen, Alsten McQueen, Cleophus McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen (lead vocal), Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell, John Phillip, Lionel Scott",Male Voice; 18 Male Voices,Men,"Chorus:

1439,12.2,-61.64,,,16138,,0:02:05,T1215.1,"Mama, Roule, Roule",Carnaval Music,"Here a typical village band of the kind that once accompanied calypso singers in Grenada performs its version of a Shortknee song. Shortknee is the name of a particular masked character with a long history in Grenada. An outgrowth of an older Carnival figure known as Pierrot Grenade (believed to have first appeared on the island in the seventeenth century), Shortknee is an aggressive character who, dressed in a distinctive costume typified by baggy trousers tied above the knee, roams the countryside during Carnival. Chanting loudly as he goes, he makes belligerent motions, jabbing at the air and sometimes throwing white powder at those who cross his path; some Shortknees stop from time to time to recite elaborate speeches combining French Creole and English. Competitive speech-making and boasting may lead to fighting, and in some areas the Shortknee and stick-fighting traditions have merged. In the past, bands of Shortknees from different villages and districts would often meet and clash, sometimes resulting in ongoing feuds.

The lyrics of the song featured here, in a mixture of French Creole and Grenadian English Creole, mention the rival villages of Chantimelle and Mount Rueil, which are famous for being at the center of Shortknee feuding. When the lead singer speaks of “me bull jumping,” he is likely referring to the long stick, called a “bull,” used as a whip by the Shortknee (and before him, by the Pierrot Grenade) to punish those who arouse his ire. Because of the unruly demeanor of Shortknee bands and the perceived potential for violence, there have been periodic attempts since colonial times to suppress this and other local masquerades (thus the references in this song to being detained in the police station). Continuing attempts to curb the boisterous behavior of such masked performers — culminating in the Carnival Regulation Act of 1990 — have led to the decline of Grenada’s indigenous Carnival, which has been largely replaced by a tamer, institutionalized version modeled on the present-day Trinidad Carnival. But the unregulated Shortknees made something of a comeback in the 1980s, and they remain active, particularly in St. Patrick’s, where Lomax made this recording.","Claudius Andall, George Claude, Alexis George, Simpson Jeremiah, Irene McQueen",Voice; 5 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

1440,12.2,-61.64,,,16138,,0:01:46,T1215.5,When We Step out on the Road,Carnaval Music,"This recording was made at a critical time in the history of Carnival and calypso in Grenada, when older forms were being supplanted by newer traditions imported from Trinidad. Up to the late 1950s, Grenada was home to a distinctive, local Afro-Caribbean Carnival based on folk traditions and costumed characters of its own, such as Shortknee and Pierrot Grenade (some of which had earlier influenced the Carnival of Trinidad). Well-known local calypso singers such as Papa Edmund and Lord Roamer usually performed with village string bands featuring some combination of banjo, guitar, cuatro, and chorus singers. These calypsonians were still known, as elsewhere in the French-influenced Caribbean, as “chantwells.” In the late 1950s, the Grenadian chantwells Lord Melody (a different individual from the better-known Lord Melody of Trinidad) and Quo Vadis introduced organized calypso tents and formal competitions based on the Trinidadian model. Calypso in Grenada, as in the other Anglophone islands, soon came to be dominated by the sounds emanating from Trinidad, a trend that continues today. The older string-band sound heard in this selection has almost disappeared from Carnival in Grenada, having long ago been displaced by the more “modern” strains of steel band and soca music. The lyrics of the song reflect the subversive spirit of Carnival, humorously overturning the norms of “proper” everyday social life; temporarily freed from normal constraints, the “saga gals” (fancy, showy, dressed-up girls) leave their watchful mothers at home and venture out on their own to take over the town.","Claudius Andall, George Claude, Alexis George, Simpson Jeremiah, Irene McQueen",Voice; 5 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:
Mami, way, ay.

In 1528, Hernán Cortés returned to Spain from Mexico, bearing the Aztec recipe for xocolatl *(chocolate drink) with him. The drink was initially received unenthusiastically and it was not until sugar was added that it became a popular drink in the Spanish courts. There were attempts to satisfy Spanish domestic demand by planting cacao in Spanish territories such as Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Trinidad, and Fernando Po (now Bioko), an island off the West African coast, but these initially came to nothing. The cultivation of cacao on a large scale by European mercantile nations began in earnest in the late seventeenth century. France introduced the crop to Martinique and St. Lucia in 1660 and to Grenada in 1714. Since then it has been one of the island’s principal exports.

Before shipment for processing, the cocoa fruit is harvested and cut open and the cocoa beans are extracted. After fermentation, the beans are placed in trays called “cocoa drawers,’’ and workers “tramp” or walk.","Daniel Alexander (lead vocal), Theophilus Daisy, Sonny Francis, Saville Greenridge, Norman Miller",Male Voice; 4 Male Voices; Tramping; Hand Claps,Men,,Alan Lomax with Anna Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

1136,13.95,-60.9,,,26137,,0:01:36,T1181.3,Èlèna,Ring Game Song; Game Song,"Many parts of the Caribbean boast thriving play-song traditions. In most cases, these play traditions are as much the province of adults as of children. Indeed, the same songs are often performed by both. Throughout the region, game songs and dances, performed with relish by groups of adults, is an essential component of wakes. Such songs and dances (and the associated games, known as “pass play,” “ring play,” etc.) may also be encountered in other contexts, and are sometimes organized purely for pleasure.

In St. Lucia, there are a number of distinct musical genres associated with play songs and dances, such as jwÈ pÚtÈ, dÈbÚt, and solo. These may be performed either with drum and percussion, or without instrumental accompaniment (in which case vigorous handclapping may supply the rhythm section). In St. Lucia as elsewhere in the Caribbean, the ideal setting for play-song sessions is a night with a full moon, when the near-total darkness that normally envelops rural areas at sunset gives way to brilliant tropical moonshine.

This selection, performed by a group of women as accompaniment to a ring game, appears to be an example of jwÈ pÚtÈ. As Lomax’s Cantometrics system would later reveal, several stylistic features of this performance – the short, syncopated repeating chorus, the vocal timbre, the overlap between the dynamic song leader and the chorus, the leader’s improvisations, and the tight, “metronomic” quality of the clapping – attest to the essentially African style of this Caribbean game song. (The stylistic differences between this example and the primarily European-derived game song on track 5 are easy to hear.) 

The exclamation “woy,” indicating surprise, amusement, fright, etc., is widespread in the French Caribbean and parts of the British and Dutch Caribbean, and can be heard in the popular music of Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and Suriname. Some linguists consider it derived from Wolof or a related West African language.",Philomene Estephane  ,Female Voice,Women,"Chorus:

St. Lucian village bands are known especially for their kwadril (quadrille) performances, but their repertoires also embrace a number of other ballroom styles. This selection is in the style known as lakonmËt (“la comËte”). LakonmËt (also sometimes called mazouk) is usually danced by couples, and is thought to be the only such ballroom music truly indigenous to St. Lucia. It may be played as a kind of warm-up dance at the beginning of a kwadril evening, or as a closing number after the cycle of five figures normally performed has been completed. Variants of lakonmËt are also associated with wakes, social dances known as dansÈ vyÚlon, and the weekly meetings and annual celebrations of the LawÚz (“La Rose”) Society, a St. Lucian music and dance organization.

As this lovely example shows, the music of Caribbean string bands is not limited to the “hotter,” more driving reworkings of European ballroom dances for which such village bands are known. Slower-tempo dance tunes, played in three-quarter time with a unique old creole charm, are also common throughout the region; in fact, indigenized varieties of the waltz, with hints of polyrhythm and polymeter, abound in the Caribbean.

Standing out in this St. Lucian example is the Caribbean-style strumming of a local version of the banjo. This style, characterized by rapid strokes used for rhythmic embellishment, is widespread in the region. A uniquely Afro-American instrument, the banjo has been used for centuries in the Caribbean and appears to have developed concurrently there and in North America, with overlap and cross-influences between the two areas.",Boy Ramine,Male Voice,Men,"Boy la, mamay-la, Boy pa mÚ,

Despite a general lack of exposure to North Indian classical music, generations of Indo-Caribbean musicians, drawing on their fragmentary knowledge and their own innovative spirit, cultivated a “local classical” genre that came to be known as tan singing. Sung at weddings and other functions, tan singing evolved into a unique idiom, with thoroughly idiosyncratic versions of North Indian classical and semiclassical genres like dhrupad, ghazal, and especially thumri, heard here. 

Trinidadian thumri bears little resemblance to its North Indian counterpart: it is distinguished primarily by its sequential rhythmic structure. This includes a curious metrical modulation during the initial sections, in which the downbeat shifts by one beat between the refrain and verse passages, before accelerating in an extendedbarhti  (in India, laggi ) section. As is standard, the singer here doubles his vocal line on harmonium, while being accompanied by dholak and dantal, a steel rod struck with a U-shaped clapper. Although in severe decline in Guyana and Suriname, tan singing is still relatively vital in Trinidad.

The text to this song, as in most tan singing, is drawn from published verse anthologies obtained from India. This verse contains the pen name of the mystical poet Kabir (1440—1518), perhaps a misattribution.","Heeralal Boodhai, Harmonium; Ramnanan Lokhai, Drums; Dindial Maharaj; Ramdial, Kharangee; Samaroo, Violin; Seebalack, Dhantal","Male Voices; Harmonium, Drums; Violin; Dhantal",Men,". . . kahe Kabir faqir pukar jhutiya beohar,

It has remained extremely popular in the Caribbean despite the decline of the Hindi language. It is generally performed by groups of male amateur singers, primarily during the springtime festival of phagwa, which celebrates the amorous dalliances of Krishna, the playful and mischievous cowherd deity.

The singers repeat one line in a set of stock melodies and rhythms, starting out with a seven-beat meter and modulating to a thunderous climax in duple meter, which then returns to the first tempo. 

The text to this verse praises Lord Rama and celebrates the examples of Mirabai, Sugrim, Bhibhushan, and other legendary figures who achieved spiritual salvation or worldly success through their devotion to Rama.","Ramnarine Bholai, Ramroop Bholai, Sitaram Bholai, Ramnanan Boochoon, Heeralal Boodhai, Gowkaren, Bhola Hansa, Ramnath Harripersad, Bisnath Jhingoo, Phoolchan Koongbeharry, Pandit Benny Madho, Mohase Mahabir, Dindial Maharaj, Kisoon Maharaj, Ratanlal Manbodh, Raghoonath Ramdass, Ramnath Ramdass, Seebalack, dholak, ghang",19 Male Voices,Men,"Tero bigre bat ban jae Ram bhajo bhae [. . .]

1339,10.16,-61.43,,,17194,,0:08:26,T1080.1,Ramayana Chaupai,Ramayana; Responsorial Song,"After the abolition of slavery, thousands of Asian Indians were transported to the Caribbean in the middle of the nineteenth century to work as indentured laborers on the ailing plantations. Today their descendants, often referred to as “East Indians,” are scattered across the region; in a few countries, such as Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, they constitute a majority or near-majority of the population. In each of these places, distinct Indian musical traditions, both Hindu and Muslim, have survived, forming an important part of the local cultural heritage. In Trinidad, certain local Indian musical genres such as chutney  and tassa  drumming have made significant contributions to urban popular music, spawning new Indo-Caribbean blends such as chutney soca.

In areas with large concentrations of Indians, such as the village of Penal, Trinidad, where this recording was made, Indian “folk” musical genres such as chowtal  continue to be performed alongside “classical” musics such as thumri  and Hindi-language devotional songs known as bhajans. According to the leader of this group as interviewed on tape by Lomax, this selection is a chaupai, or Hindu holy prayer, traditionally sung in January, when the annual custom of bathing in the sacred river Ganges is observed by Indian sages and others. In poetic language, the sung prayer recounts episodes in the life of the Lord Rama.  In his notes Lomax wrote with particular enthusiasm of his own participation in the session in which this recording was made: 

The group sat cross-legged in a circle on the floor of the school pavilion. The leader had a great volume of the Ramayana open before him on a reading stand. To his left were two drummers. All singers had brass cymbals held loosely in the palms of their hands by leather thongs attached to wooden handles. They clashed them against each other, following the rhythm of the lead or the drum. I joined the circle after a time and entered an entirely new world. Suddenly I had joined a circle of equals. . . . The faces of my singing mates were full of joy and power, independence and beauty. They opened their throats and their hearts opened at the same time. We all chanted and clashed exactly together, as a group of equal males sweeping us into wave after wave of accelerated tempo. . . . I have never felt so welcome, so much at home in a group.","Phoolchan Koongbeharry, male chorus, dholak, ghang",Male Voice; Male Voices; Dholak; Ghang,Men,,Alan Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

In the Caribbean, Indian women maintained a rich repertoire of Bhojpuri folk songs, most typically related to specific functions (such as work), life-cycle events (weddings, childbirths, etc.), or festivals. Unfortunately, due to the decline of Hindi in English-speaking Trinidad and Guyana, many such songs are now known only by elders, or have been forgotten altogether. In this excerpt, a group of women sing a lullaby, “Jhulo, Jhulo, Kanhaiya” – “Swing, Swing, Kanhaiya” – addressed to the infant Krishna as he dozes in a swing.","Mrs. Lutchman Ramsubhag, dholak, dhantal, female voice",Female Voice; Dholak; Dhantal,Women,"Jhulo, jhulo, Kanhaiya palna.

In 1815–16, nearly a thousand black Baptists from South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Maryland — ex-slaves who had fought on the British side in the War of 1812 — arrived as refugees in Trinidad. Settling at first on Crown lands in the south-central part of the island, many were eventually transferred to special settlements called “company villages.” The inhabitants of these villages, who came to be known by other Trinidadians as “Merikins” (Americans), maintained a separate identity based in part on the distinct Southern Baptist form of worship they brought with them. Today some of their descendants live in the five remaining company villages, one of which, Indian Walk, is where the present selection was recorded.

According to one school of thought, the unique variant of Afro-Baptist worship practiced in these company villages, clearly rooted in the emerging North American black Baptist tradition of the late eighteenth century, was the main source of the Spiritual Baptist faith of Trinidad. Whether or not this theory is correct, there is no doubt that the religion of these North American descendants has significantly influenced (and been influenced by) not only the Spiritual Baptist religion but a number of other Afro-Trinidadian faiths. Indeed, there are well-established connections between the company village Baptist churches and the neo-African Shango or Orisha religion. For example, one of the performers on this selection, Ebenezer Elliott (known to many as Papa Neza [Nezer]) – a U.S. African-American descendant who was born at Third Company Village – was at the time of recording both a deacon in the Indian Walk London Baptist church and one of the most revered and influential Shango priests (mongba ) on the island.

This recording, made during a Sunday morning Communion service, features the handclapping, foot stamping, and exclamations of some fifty members of the congregation. The melodic structure, verbal content, and bluesy intonation of this spiritual, not to mention the style of performance, link it unambiguously with African-American religious and musical traditions to the north. Lomax felt the historical connection immediately; on one of his field tapes made in this community, he could be heard yelling excitedly, “We sing that, too!”","Reverend A. Dickson, Ebenezer Elliot",2 Male Voices,Men,"When I go home, tell the Lord,

1413,10.15,-61.48,,,27462,,0:02:35,T1073.2,Doption,Doption; Spiritual,"Most of the better-known Afro-Caribbean religions, such as Cuban SanterÌa or Haitian Vodun, developed in conjunction with Catholicism, which was introduced to the Spanish and French slave colonies early in their histories. In the British Caribbean, in contrast, large-scale missionization began relatively late, and it was not until the nineteenth century that a series of new Afro-Protestant religions came into being. These include, among other faiths, the various Revival or Poco churches of Jamaica and the Spiritual Baptists of St. Vincent, Grenada, and Trinidad, also known as Shouters (although nowadays most practitioners reject the latter term).

Spiritual Baptist music is based largely on nineteenth-century British and American Protestant hymnody, transformed by Afro-Caribbean musical aesthetics. Normally there is no instrumental accompaniment in Spiritual Baptist music (with the exception of occasional bell ringing); but handclapping, foot stamping, and other forms of body percussion are integral to performances. Although an organ can be heard faintly in the background in the present selection, this instrument is rarely present in Spiritual Baptist services.

Recorded during a Sunday service, this is a vivid example of what Spiritual Baptists call “shouting” or “trumpeting in the spirit” – a combination of singing-chanting, percussive body movement, and layered rhythmic vocalization that serves to intensify the experience of collective worship as a service becomes “hotter” and episodes of possession by the spirit of the Holy Ghost begin to occur. The rhythmic hyperventilation that can be heard at several points, known as “doption” or “adoption,” is not only an essential component of the music, but a device used to aid worshippers in achieving the exalted state of spirit possession.

The sublime performance caught here, with its dense rhythmic texture and its buildup of communal “heat,” may be seen as a testament to the triumph of Afro-American style over European form in the musical expressions of Afro-Protestant religions in the Caribbean. Similarly inspiring performances, in much the same style, can be heard in the “bands choruses” of Revival churches in Jamaica.","Bennnette Baptist, Florence Cowan, Reverend Olsie Cowan, Sister Jacobs, Medford Joshua, Percival Joshua, Adris Matisse, Mary McSween, Elena Paul, Emelda Smith, John D.

In most Caribbean societies, the great importance of death as a rite of passage is reflected in the amount of cultural energy focused on wakes. Caribbean wakes bring together a variety of dance and music genres, ranging from hymn singing and string-band music to story songs and neo-African drumming. In fact, most of the genres on this sampler – even ones normally associated with other activities – are also performed at wakes.

Afro-Trinidadian wakes, particularly in rural areas, often include what is known as bongo dancing. The bongo tradition, which is meant to commemorate and placate the spirits of the recently deceased and other ancestors, centers on a competitive dance between two males to the accompaniment of topical, often satirical, songs performed antiphonally by one or more chantwells (lead singers) and chorus. Songs are usually backed by drumming and/or other percussion, in some instances including tamboo bamboo orchestras. Sometimes pole dancing and games also form part of bongo performances.

In this instance, we hear the singers, accompanied by handclapping, make a transition into vocal percussion — a widespread African-American performance technique. The three-plus-three-plus-two additive rhythm carried by the sticks and clapping represents a common thread running through Afro-Atlantic music from Brazil to the United States.

The present example is a very popular bongo game song, recorded at an actual wake. The brief description of the surroundings preserved in Lomax’s notes provides a good sense of the setting at a typical Caribbean wake: 

Inside the house the friends of the family gossiped quietly, drank coffee and rum, then sang hymns – in the backyard, dice and games.

Aside from its aesthetic value, the bongo tradition is historically important in that, along with kalinda, bÈlÈ, parang, and tamboo bamboo, it also contributed to the musical development of Trinidad’s famed calypso.","Cyril Balfour, Julian Carey, Paul Charles, R.

Before the turn of the century, the term bÈlÈ (or bel air) was most often used in Trinidad to refer to a variety of drum dances accompanied by songs in French Creole.  These drum-dance traditions were introduced to Trinidad by immigrants from other islands – particularly Martinique, but also Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, and Dominica –and eventually elements from all of them fused into an indigenized Trinidadian form of bÈlÈ. This dance music was at first associated with local festivals held on public holidays, presided over by an elected “king” and “queen,” and usually featuring satirical songs and other kinds of social commentary. This indigenized Trinidadian bÈlÈ tradition — and especially its satirical song component – was gradually assimilated into the annual Carnival in Port of Spain and other urban areas.

In some parts of the island, such as Diego Martin, Toco, and Maraval, however, variants of the bÈlÈ survived well into this century. In these twentieth-century forms of bÈlÈ, women play a leading role as singers and dancers, showing off their old-style French Creole attire while performing songs in the French-based Creole that is no longer spoken by the majority of Trinidadians. Normally, from two to five male drummers provide the rhythmic underpinnings.

Several musical substyles exist within Trinidadian bÈlÈ. The present selection, which captures a performance on stage by a trained folkloric ensemble, consists of the musical accompaniment to what is known in Trinidad and elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles as pikÈ – a lively dance style characterized by pelvic-centered movements.","Thomasine Affet, Sylvia Baptiste, Mickey Bentic, Edward Goddard, George Julian, Alexander Matthew, Gloria Mendez, Avien Morris, Antoinette Navarro, Joseph Noel, Amy Patrick, Yvonne Perez, Angela Phillip, Umilta Sladden, chac-chac, drum ensemble","13 Mixed Voices; Chac Chac; Drum Ensemble

1397,10.77,-61.24,,,27457,,0:03:03,T1067.2,Manzanari,Parang,"A relatively obscure yet important branch of Trinidad’s music, rooted in Spanish traditions, is parang  (derived from the Spanish word parranda, referring to a spree, a binge, or a group of nocturnal serenaders). Although the parang tradition is believed to have originated during the long period of Spanish rule in Trinidad (1498–1797), the Afro-Spanish music called parang today is primarily a product of more recent immigration from neighboring Venezuela. Although it may be performed in several contexts (such as vieux croix, or cross wake, ceremonies), parang music is most closely associated with Christmas revelries. Originally, the term referred only to Christmas serenading, but in recent times its meaning has been extended to encompass the entire range of Venezuelan-influenced musics associated with Trinidad’s “Spanish” population. 

Every Christmas season bands of parranderos (parang performers) go from house to house serenading listeners with aguinaldos – Spanish-language carols celebrating the life of Christ. The instruments most commonly used are guitar, cuatro, mandolin, violin, and maracas, to which a “box bass” – a bass sanza resembling the Cuban marÌmbula or Jamaican rumba box – is sometimes added. 

The aguinaldos always performed during the Christmas season are followed by songs in a genre known as the manzanare. Manzanare songs, of which the present selection is an example, tend to revolve around the Christian theme of redemption in the next life – the lyrics dwell on the mythical Rio Manzanares, envisioned as a beautiful river to be crossed on the way to a better world. The refrain of the song featured here, beginning “Palomita blanca, pata color·,” probably derives from a well-known Venezuelan children’s song that goes “palomita blanca, copetico azul, / llevame en tus alas, a ver a Jesus” (Little white dove with blue crest, / Carry me on your wings to see Jesus). 

Most contemporary parang performers are no longer conversant in Spanish, and the lyrics they sing usually represent formulaic passages that have undergone changes in pronunciation as they have been passed down across the generations. Yet although much of what is sung today is a kind of pseudo-Spanish, most of which is no longer intelligible even to the performers themselves, some parang singers are quite adept at lyrical improvisation. Manzanare performers are also allowed considerable latitude for instrumental improvisation. The stirring runs improvised by the guitarist in between the verses of this selection illustrate this very nicely.

The parang and the Venezuelan string band tradition associated with it had a significant impact on the musical development of calypso beginning in the 1890s and continuing into the 1920s. Not only did Venezuelan-style string bands (including guitars, cuatros, and violins) make their way into the calypso tents of Carnival during this period, but by the 1930s Venezuelan-influenced musical arrangements could be heard on commercial calypso recordings. Reflecting on the parang orchestras he heard in Trinidad in 1962, Lomax later wrote that “to my mind their music is the equal of anything in this hemisphere for fire, originality, and charm.”","Sicirao Ramaize, Rose of Shannon Singers",Male Voice; Mixed Voices; Guitar,Mixed adults,"Palomita blanca, pata color·,

Although the origins of the tamboo bamboo bands are not entirely clear, the crucial role they played in the development of Carnival music is well established. It is likely that bamboo stamping tubes, based on Central African models, existed in Trinidad prior to 1900 (perhaps having been introduced there directly from Africa, or perhaps from other islands), but it was not until around the turn of the century, in the wake of the 1884 act that led to the suppression of drumming in public spaces, that tamboo bamboo emerged as the main kind of percussion music in Carnival processions. These bamboo bands actually succeeded in transferring to a new medium the individual drum parts, and certain of the rhythms, of neo-African drumming traditions that had recently been banned from Carnival. The supporting drum of kalinda or bÈlÈ, for instance, known as bula or foulÈ, was replaced by the mid-range bamboo instrument named after it, which similarly played supporting rhythmic patterns; the lead drum, or cutter, was reborn as the high-pitched bamboo tube of the same name, on which improvised lead rhythms were beaten with a stick (called kwakwa); bass parts were provided by a larger piece of bamboo called the boom.

The Kongo origins of the tamboo bamboo style are suggested not only by the hocketing technique of the instruments, but also by an exact parallel in Cuban Kongo religions, where tree branches (called garabato in Spanish, and lungowa in the Cuban Kongo language) are struck rhythmically against the ground in funeral ceremonies as a way of awakening the powers that reside in the earth. The deep significance of this Cuban musical tradition (which has likely never been heard in Trinidad) would doubtless not be lost on Trinidadian tamboo bamboo players, who rhythmically strike the earth at wake ceremonies, thereby connecting the living and the dead.

Bamboo bands once performed throughout the year, not only at wakes but also at kalinda dances and stickfighting competitions. As the upper and middle classes in Port of Spain became increasingly involved in Carnival, patronizing the calypso tents and sponsoring a shift to string band music, the tamboo bamboo bands that continued to spring up in poorer neighborhoods kept the grassroots side of Carnival – the various street-oriented processions and revelries—alive and well. The tamboo bamboo orchestras of Carnival were the direct precursors of the steel bands that emerged in the 1940s and rose to prominence in the following decades. The steel drum, or pan, was actually invented by younger tamboo bamboo players, who had been experimenting with makeshift metal instruments since the 1930s. Just as the bamboo bands had earlier replaced the kalinda drums, the pan or steel band tradition quickly supplanted tamboo bamboo as the street music of Carnival. As a result, this bamboo music, which looms so large in the history of Carnival and calypso, has almost disappeared from Trinidad.

This recording, made by Lomax in 1962 when the tamboo bamboo tradition was still regularly practiced in pockets of the island, is a rare and valuable document. Not only does it convey a vivid impression of what grassroots Carnival music in Trinidad must have sounded like earlier this century, but it helps us to appreciate the strongly African roots of the steel band sound, which is now heard around the world. The martial theme of the song performed here – a well-known stickfighting tune with French Creole, or “patois,” lyrics—reveals the overlapping heritage of tamboo bamboo bands and kalinda stickfighters.","Vasco de Freitas, Albert Dowdy, Sylvie Felix, Johnnie Fournillier, Malcolm Jordan, Ned Joseph, Uric O' Brien, Donald Roberts, Oliver Scott, Ellick Waithe, Reynold Waithe

The song is but one in a series of Trinidadian calypsos that stereotypically portray Hispanic women as passionate lovers. When arranging to record Tiger in 1962, Lomax, quite fittingly, decided to put the great calypsonian together with a string band made up of traditional parang musicians. The session resulted in a splendid old-time, Venezuelan-tinged sound that nicely complemented Tiger’s overall style, but went especially well with the lyrics of “SeÒorita Panchita.” (Neville Marcano is also featured on Growling Tiger in the Portraits series of The Alan Lomax Collection on Rounder Records.)","Neville Marcano, known as Growling Tiger, Eugene Brito, Ralph Charles, Robert Charles, Paul Gervais, Samuel Mira, Vivian Moses, Randolph Phipps, Emmanuel Williamsfiddle, flute, 2 guitars, cuatro, bass, chac-chac",Male Voice; 8 Male Voices; Fiddle; Flute; 2 Guitars; Cuatro; Bass; Chac-Chac,Men,"SeÒorita Panchita,

“AquÌ yo estoy batallando,” [I’m here struggling]

It was an afternoon in December,
When the cutty call Hombre in the harbor.

Walking round the city melancholy.
When you speak of beauty and personality,
With sex appeal looking resplendently,
The tear in her eyes spoke indisputably,
She were in love with no less a person than me.
She said, “Donde vive?” [Where do you live?] and she began.
But then I told her, “SeÒorita, me no compran.” [Miss, I don’t understand]
She said, “El Tigre, mi amor, you I love,” [Tiger, my love, you I love]
“Ay, Dios mi!” [Heavens!], and was looking above.
She told me that her name were Carmelita Panchita.

This is a ""single tone"" calypso, or one in which the verses have four lines.  ""Indian Prince"" was a Trinidadian Hindu named Robert Haytasingh (Hindus comprise approximately half of Trinidad's population).  As is customary, all three proclaim their musical superiority.  Tiger and Iere mix in references to the arms and space race, while the Prince is more nationalistic, including a reference to then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964).  Tiger's opening verse echo's one by legendary first generation calypsonian William ""The Conqueror"" Pastee, one of the first calypsonians he heard as a boy:

They may walk by day
They may walk by night
Tell them I bring King Fanto with me
So the devil and the angel can't trouble me 

According to Tiger's biographer, Rawle Gibbons, this song was an early favorite of young Neville Marcano in the 1920's. ""King Fanto"" was another giant of the early calypso era.","Growling Tiger (Neville Marcano), Lord Iere (Randolph Thomas), Indian Prince (Robert Haytasingh).

The bÈlÈ tradition of Martinique, which goes back to the eighteenth century, is more elaborate than most of the traditions going by the same name in other parts of the Caribbean. The traditional Martinican bÈlÈ comprises eight or more distinct sections or “figures,” each with its own rhythms and movements, e.g., bÈlÈ, grand bÈlÈ, bÈlia, bidjin, kanigwÈ, ting-bang. Some figures are derived in part from European ballroom dances, while others are entirely local creations and display clearer African influence.

The selection heard here is a bÈlÈ bidjin – a stylistic variant of bÈlÈ that is one of the main sources of the beguine, the popular dance music for which Martinique has been internationally known since the 1920s. It uses the traditional bÈlÈ instrumentation of a single drummer, accompanied by a second player who beats the back of the drum with two sticks called tibwa (ti-bois). The rhythmic pattern typically played on the tibwa, which in the 1980s became a signature rhythm of French Antillean zouk, is of probable Central African origin. The drummer, sitting astride his instrument, skillfully modifies the pitch by pressing one foot against the skin – another Central African feature. This drumming technique, which has been developed to a high art in the bÈlÈ tradition, is virtually identical to the method used to change pitch in Haitian djouba, Jamaican tambo and kumina, balsiÈ-playing in the Dominican Republic, and several other Caribbean drumming traditions.

The bÈlÈ has always been concentrated in the northern part of the island, where the plantations were generally larger and African influences stronger. This recording was made in the northeastern coastal village of Sainte-Marie, a bÈlÈ stronghold known for producing more than its share of accomplished performers. In fact, the lead singer on this selection, Raoul Grivalliers, was later to become one of the leading exponents of the rural bÈlÈ, releasing several LPs and, more recently, compact discs. Affectionately known to his countrymen as Ti Raoul, Ti Ayoul, or simply Ti Ra, he is revered throughout Martinique, and has also performed in several other countries, including France, the United States and Cuba. The 1990s have seen a modest revival of bÈlÈ among younger Martinicans, and there are now a number of small but active groups in the island devoted to the continuation of the tradition.","Raoul Grivalliers, Augustin Gourpil, Malcousu Florius, Casimir Grivallier, Florent Baratini, tanbou bélè, tibwa, chorus",2 Male Voices; Tanbou Bélè; Tibwa; Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"MariwÚz-o!

Danmyé is not strictly a North Atlantic tradition and is practiced all over the island. It is a competitive sport for men (and today, a few young women), combining music, martial arts, and wrestling. It likely derives from Africa, where competitive martial arts are a popular traditional practice. Danmyé normally opens evenings of performance, which is probably why Ti Raoul sang it first.

Like the boula in Guadeloupe, the Martinican drum tanbou bèlè is laid on the ground and straddled. Martinican drummers (tanbouyé) frequently use one heel to change pitch and with their left hand play a lateral roll between the ring finger or pinky and the index finger or thumb. A second percussionist plays a supporting ostinato by striking the side of the drum with a pair of sticks, the tibwa. Transverse heeled drumming and sticks-on-drum accompaniment both suggest a central African (Congolese) derivation, and both are found in early descriptions of black dance from Louisiana to Guyane and Brazil, especially in areas of former French colonialism.

Danmyé drumming has a specific basic rhythmic pattern and characteristic variations, but improvisations are frequent and elaborate. Drummers follow the contestants closely, their timing accents and rolls to the fighters’ blows. Baratini's imaginative phrasing in this selection captures the energy of a danmyé match, and his wide range of sounds demonstrates the technique of a master tanbouyé.

Ti Raoul explained this song to Lomax: “Robè sété an jwè danmyé, mé kon ité ka jwé danmyé anpil yo bay non ‘machine’. Mé kan i rivé dan ron danmyé, i jwen an kanmarad ki sipériyèy, quoi. Alò yo fè an chanté anlèy.” (“Robert was a danmyé player. Because he used to play danmyé a lot people called him ‘Machine.’ But one day he arrived in a danmyé circle and met a comrade who was superior. So, people made a song about him.”) The song’s dominant metaphor is an old one: in the French Antillean islands, slave owners referred to black people’s bodies as animated machines, a custom that has continued. Here, not only is Robert himself a “machine,” but his stronger opponent is called a bus.","Raoul Grivalliers, Florent Baratini, tanbou bélè, tibwa, chorus",2 Male Voices; Tanbou Bélè; Tibwa; Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Ti Raoul: Robè Machin

Like danmyé, bèlè is accompanied by one tanbou bèlè and tibwa. Bèlè choreography is an adaption of late the eighteenth-century quadrille craze, with its four-couple, square dance choreography. The genre includes several dances, bidjin bèlè (or bèlè dous — “sweet bèlè”) being influenced by the song and dance movements of urban biguine.

Like most bèlè songs, “Malavwa” is usually interpreted by a lead singer alternating with a chorus. Here, however, Ti Raoul opens with the song’s chorus and his mother, Man Clémence, another excellent singer, takes the lead, others joining them only on the final word of each stanza. The meaning of the final word (léwado, léwadyo) is unknown to us. Malavwa, bik, kérol and cocotéis are names of various types of sugarcane.","Raoul Grivalliers, Florent Baratini, tanbou bélè, tibwa, chorus",2 Male Voices; Tanbou Bélè; Tibwa; Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Ti Raoul: Malavwa, malavwa, malavwa yé

They may be of African origin, like the well-known Anansi cycle, or they may be more creole, with a clear European input heard in references to European-type kings, queens, princesses, castles, and similar thematic elements. This selection from Martinique is an excellent example of Cantometric Style B, the group-dominated performance style.
 
In Caribbean storytelling in French-influenced areas, the dynamic relationship between performer and audience is often set into motion with the antiphonal opening formula “cric! – crac!” which appears from Haiti south to Trinidad. Sometimes it is repeated throughout the performance, reinforcing the bond between storyteller and audience. The call-and-response structure is also typical of Style B, where a single performer may even provide his own responses, thus implying the presence of an audience. The folk tale excerpted here is a humorous story about a man who has a clarinet, chak-chak (maracas) and violin.","Malcousu Florius, Augustin Gourpil, Casimir Grivalliers, Raoul Grivalliers",4 Male Voices,Men,"The final lines are as follows:

Here is another adaptation of the late eighteenth-century quadrille craze, this one closer to the original than bèlè. Like bèlè, haute-taille is regional, being restricted to a few towns in Martinique’s mid-Atlantic area. As of 2002, only about four groups were active.

Haute-taille may be accompanied by a variety of instruments, usually some combination of accordion, violin, cha-cha, syak (bamboo scraper), and tanbou dibas (Basque or bass drum — the etymology is uncertain), a large frame drum played by both striking and rubbing. The ensemble is one example of a widespread Caribbean type, the small-town band featuring strings (violin, guitar, banjo), accordion, and light percussion. In haute-taille, one musician, usually the player of the tanbou dibas, acts as koumandè, directing the dancers during the complex figures. Each “set” or predetermined sequence of quadrille dances is followed by three or four “non-set” dances chosen from the late nineteenth-century repertoire of couple dances: biguine, mazurka, and valse. For the non-set dances there are no commands, although the koumandè sings. Bernard Karaman followed this pattern by recording for Lomax a sampling of set dance pieces followed by two biguines, including “Ti Coco Malélivé,” and a mazurka. As in the custom in haute-taille Karaman sings alone, covering both the call and the response of this song. The commands he gives are for the second figure of the haute-taille set, the chaine anglaise.","Bernard Karaman, tanbou, dibas and vocals, Francius Laurence, accordion, Paulimy Laurence, chacha","Male Voice; Mixed Voices; Tanbou, Dibas; Voices;  Accordion; Chacha",Mixed adults,"Ti Coco malélivé (2x)

The quadrille, a popular nineteenth-century figured dance from Western Europe, has been a target of creolization in many parts of the former colonial world, from the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean to the Caribbean. One rural Martinican variant of the quadrille, the haute-taille (also known as taille-haute) is seen as being especially typical of the southern part of the island.

 The haute-taille (meaning “high waist”) is named after a high-waisted style of dress once popular at quadrille dances in Martinique and other islands. Like the quadrille of nearby Guadeloupe, the Martinican haute-taille is composed of four main figures (le pantalon, l’ÈtÈ, la poule, and pastourelle), to which a fifth figure (played in another local style, such as mazouk, beguine, etc.) is often added. Instrumentation may vary from accordion, as in this selection, to violin, guitar, and a variety of percussion, including a large frame drum called tanbou dibas (in this instance replaced by a tambourine). The caller (commandeur) plays a more prominent role in the haute-taille than in other forms of quadrille in this part of the island, constantly directing and encouraging the dancers with commands and sung interludes.

With its jaunty, British-sounding accordion melody, its Caribbeanized dance calls, and its rhythmic drive (punctuated by the heavy accents of the tambourine), this selection provides a beautiful example of musical rapprochement between Europe and Africa – in this case the balance clearly being tilted more toward the European than the African side.","Bernard Karaman, tanbou, dibas and vocals, Francius Laurence, accordion, Paulimy Laurence, chacha","Male Voice; Mixed Voices; Tanbou, Dibas; Voices;  Accordion; Chacha",Mixed adults,,Alan Lomax with Antoinette Marchand,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

Dancers have a various collection of dances, as well as comic and serious. In every repertoire of performances, a dancer mimics a hunted deer. The movements of the deer are realistically imitated as he grazes and then picks up his head to look around or violently leaps away, consistently with nervousness of a startled animal. 

Three or four musicians accompany the Deer dancer by singing the deer song in low-pictched voices in unison and playing on notched rasping sticks and the water drum. The rasping stick is a notched strip of wood played by setting down one of the ends on an inverted half gourd and stroking it with another stick. The water drum, that used in this recording, is an unusually interesting instrument. It consists of a half gourd laying on the surface with the open side downward in a wooden bowl filled with water and beaten accordingly with the rasping sticks.  (Henrietta Urchenko, Indian Music of Mexico, Ethnic Folkways Library, Album No. FE 4413, 1952)","Male chorus, sticks, water drum",Male Voices; Sticks; Water Drum,Men,"Translation of two fragmnets of Deer Dance song:

The mountain grass
Moved with the gently blowing breeze
And whistled softly.

And blows with the wind.

""The tenor voice of the singer is of vigorous expressiveness; he uses a guttural technique with a strongly nasal resonance, typical for Eastern music. Vocal sections accompanied by tar and doyra alternate with purely instrumental ones. The former comprise predominantly four, the latter predominantly two measures; however we find vocal phrases covering up to 13 measures. There the singer uses the whole tone material which consists of a diatonic scale in the Dorian mode extending over an eleventh. The lowest tone and its fourth are raised up to a quarter tone while the tonic is placed on the second lowest note. Similar to the preceding song, the tone material develops gradually towards the height; so the first two phrases are limited to the lowest third. The next two ones to the lowest seventh . The highest register is reached by a wide skip leading from the tonic to its upper octave. Rhythmically interesting is the fact that the first measure of each phrase starts with an eighth or fourth rest. The band gives only a part of the very eleborate song. The participation of the singer consists of two predominently melismatic phrases. The first one moves within the sixth range c d e f g a with the strongly stressed tonic e as center. The second one comprises the seventh range d e f g a b c which structurally may be considered as a linking of the two tetrachords d e f g and g a b c.""

This is performed by duet, Moong King-sin and Wong Yuk-ping. Both women are playing instruments, ben-cho, woo tip kam and yee-wu, while singing.

Story is about a girl named Choi Lin who was bought by an official to be his concubine; however, there is a young man, Yat Man, who is in love with Choi Lin. He suggested her to hide from the official in a school. This piece is about Choi Lin is telling a story of how she became to be sold as a slave. When her mother passed away, her dad sold her to make enough money to pay for her mother's funeral. Forteen years has passed since she was sold. After being sold, she lived a very harsh and miserable life by being mistreated by people who bought her. Yat Man comforts her and suggests that some time soon her father will buy her back by recognizing her generosity in letting herself be sold. But Choi Lin tells him that her father (a tenant farmer) was killed by police because he did have money to pay his taxes. She compares herself to a kite whose flight height is determined by other people. If the string breaks, the kite can fly anywhere as high as it wants but not knowing where it is going.

The first stanza, composed before the Pacific War, hails the delights of the southern islands. After the war Mr. Origuchi added a second stanza charged with tremendous emotional significance. The story has grown to the proportions of a patriotic legend and details are difficult to verify. During the American solders landing, they sought refuge in one of the thousands of hillside caves. From these caves the Japanese soldiers fought the Americans by constant sniping and surprise sallies; this tactic was countered by use of flame-throwers. When American voices called"" Come out and surrender!"" the terrified girls could not utter a sound, and all of them died in the flames. A probable majority of families throughout the islands mourn daughters, sisters, or cousins. At public memorial services in 1951 on Okinawa, most of those present believed that they heard the girls' voices singing in the sky; hence the name, Heavenly Children. Symbolic of the agony of the bereaved parents, this song plays an important role in contemporary Ryukyuan psychology. (Douglas G.

""O Shariputra! Phenomena are not different from
Sunya and Sunya is not different from phenomena.
Phenomena are Sunya and Sunya is phenomena.

O Shariputra, all is Sunya. Nothing comes into existence nor passes out of existence. There is no purity and no impurity; no increase nor decrease. Therefore in Sunya there is no form, no sensetion, no thought, no volition, no perception; there is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; and there is no form, sound, odor, taste, touch,  nor consciousness. There is neither field of vision nor field of thought and consciousness.

In Sunya there is no ignorance and no extinction of ignorance. There is neither decay nor death; nor is there termination of decay and deat, there is no suffering, no source of suffering, nor annihilation of suffering, and no path to the annihilation of suffering. 

In Sunya there is no knowledge, likewise no attainment in knowledge as there is nothing to attain. 

The mind of the Bodhisattva which has found its source in the Prajna Paramita is without hindrances and he has no fear. Going beyond all hindrances and illusions he reaches Perfect Enlightenment.

All the Buddhas of the past, present and future have found their surces in the Prajna Paramita; they have found Perfect Enlightenment.""

Therefore we know that the Prajna Paramita is the Great Gatha, the Gatha of Great Wisdom, the Supreme Gatha, the unequaled Gatha which is capable of removing all suffering.

Translation (by S. Ihara and K. Matsunami):

Those who attain enlightenment meet the Shakyamuni Buddha face to face. There are differences in human personality; some men are clever and others not. The teachings of the masters of the South and North are but different expressions of the same thing. The source of the teaching is clear, and though the tributaries are muddy, the awakened mind returns to the source. Clinging to practice, there is still suffering; clinging to reason will not produce Satori. 

When they enter the gates of the senses, interdependent phenomena appear unrelated. Phenomena are interdependent and, furthermore, interpenetration takes place. If there were no interpenetration, there would be no escape from differentiation.

The characteristics of form are different; pleasure and suffering appear unrelated. For the awakened, superior and inferior cannot be distinguished; for the unawakened, only duality is apparent.

The four elements return to their source, as children return to their mother. Fire heats; wind moves, water wets; earth supports. For eyes, there is form and color (rupa); for ears there is sound; for the nose there is smell; for the tongue there is taste. Without these organs, we cannot experience the phenomenal world. All the leaves on a tree are dependent on the root. All differentiations arise from the same origin. All expressions describe the same reality.

In the phenomenal world, there is enlightenment. In enlightenment can be found the phenomenal world. The two cannot be separated; they intermingle. The phenomenal and enlightened worlds depend on each other like backward steps. Everything has it's use though values vary with time and place. Reality and ideality must meet, as did the arrows of Hiai and Kisho.

When we hear words, we shoud trace their source. We shouldn't cling to words, their spirit only is important. The visible world is only that this is all we need to know.

We are always on the path; Satori is neither near nor far. Since we cannot see the path, Satori always seems a distant goal. Those who are seeking the way, may I advise them not to waste any time.

Groups of these Aromanians moved across Romanian frontiers in the period between the World Wars, most of them settling in colonies on the Black Sea coast. Unlike the Romanian peasants proper, the Aromanians have preserved old ways of part-singing. The present example illustrates the polyphonic technique used by the F¦r³ero·i Aromanians from Albania and northwestern Greece. A leader begins the song. Toward the end of the first line another leading voice enters with a new tune and is followed by the rest of the group, who sing a tonic drone throughout the piece. Here and there, “dissonant” clashes occur between the three parts. One can consider that this style forms a link between the polyphony of southern Albania (perhaps also of Sardinia) and that of the Georgians of Transcaucasia.","Arhand Musi, Andronica Caramitru, group of village women",Male Voice; 2 Female Voices,Mixed adults,"Ti³ tu munte, muntili deai Smolca,

For generations bards have sung through the land of the deeds of heroes past and present. These songs have traditionally been accompanied by the gusle, a bowed instrument with one horsehair string. Styles of playing this instrument and of singing the epics vary from one district to another, and to those who are deeply immersed in this tradition individual styles also vary. The singing of Lazar Radak in this recording belongs to the southern Herzegovinian and Montenegrin style, with modifications probably developed during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In the western countryside, ancient ritual songs are performed that do not lament the dead but are sung by specially chosen women at prescribed moments of the funeral. They beseech the sun not to rise till the dead person has all the food and drink he needs for his journey “from the land of pity to the pitiless land.” They speak of planting and decorating a pine tree at the head of the grave. The language and the ritual setting of these chants are survivals of an archaic oral tradition from the dawn of modern European history.

The present example is a fragment of a lengthy song for the procession to the graveyard, in which the dead man is given instructions for a safe journey to the other world. As a rule, Romanian singing is strictly homophonic, but in parts of the southern region (Banat, for instance) a rudimentary polyphony appears in the ritual chants. Here, the groups sing in antiphony, each group prolonging its final note to overlap the other group’s entry, resulting in a drone harmony.",Group of old women,Elderly Female Voices,Women,"Fire, fire, trandafire

These orchestras, modeled after the Russian Moiseev ensemble, were organized by the Communist authorities to create a spectacular national music, presenting a model of discipline and coordination, and hence to co-opt and control the somewhat anarchic field of traditional music and musicians. The orchestras of thirty to sixty players (traditional groups had only three to four musicians, recently five to seven), led by a conductor, were composed of excellent virtuoso instrumentalists (lªutar). Though required to learn musical notation, most did not do so and often managed to preserve a rather beautiful traditional style of playing, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. 

When it began, the Barbu Lªutaru Orchestra — the most famous in the country at the time of this recording — was under the auspices of the Folklore Institute. Tiberiu Alexandru played an important role in choosing its repertoire and style of interpretation. It was entirely supported by the state and was heavily promoted nationally. No survey of folk and popular music in Romania can ignore the folk orchestras of the Communist period or overlook their widespread influence. Thus the present record brightly concludes with a concert piece by the Barbu Lªutaru Orchestra playing with the famous panpipe player Fªnicª Luca, featured here on “Cioc<rlia” (The Lark).","Fănică Luca, panpipe, Barbu Lăutaru Orchestra ","Female Voice, Panpipe; Orchestra",Women,,Tiberiu Alexandru,1950,Columbia Records,"Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: Romania.

There it is hung on a beam and kept until next seedtime, when its grains will be mixed with those about to be sown.

The processional song tells of a girl who, distracted by the good looks of her sweetheart, cuts herself with the scythe.

The colindª or colind (the name comes most probably from the Latin calendae) is a ritual song performed during the colindat, one of the turn-of-the-year festivals, by young men (and also by children, married couples, old men, and mixed choruses, depending on the region and the precise moment of the ceremony). The most important group is the company of young lads who go from house to house singing carols, complimenting the master of the house and seeking alms. Eventually, they enter for a drink and a short dancing party. The colindª sung in this context are tailored specifically to the occupants. There are colonnades addressed to young men and marriageable girls; to the farmer, fisherman, carpenter, shoemaker, mayor, or priest; to young couples, newborn babies, or the newly deceased. The powerful delivery and vigorous rhythms of the colindª fascinated BŽla Bart—k, who compiled hundreds of colindª melodies into a book (Melodien der Rumaenien Colinde, Munich, 1923) and composed a sequence of piano pieces based on Romanian colindª tunes. The huge racket made by the colindªtori (participants in the colindat) is supposed to exorcise any malevolent spirits that have accumulated in the village during the course of the year.

Some colindª are based on folk legends related to the Miraculous Birth. The oldest — and the most widespread until the middle of the century — recite the adventures of folk heroes in epic style, incidentally invoking Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary at the end, amid wishes for prosperity. Archaic pagan elements abound in both types; in the remote past, apparently, the colindat were sung at festivals celebrating the winter solstice.","Nine village men, duba, drum",9 Male Voices; Duba; Drum,Men,"Pleacª june-ntr-un v<natu’,

Indeed, the Columbaria grotto, near Or³ova on the Danube, was known since antiquity as the breeding place of flies that spread cattle pestilence.

The Romanian epic song stems from the medieval sung poetry of the troubadours and trouv‹res, on the one hand, and on the other, from the old Balkan epic traditions. The southern part of Romania  including Wallachia, Oltenia, and Dobrogea  has developed a very complex, imaginative, and special musical form for the epic song, called in these regions c<ntec bªtr<nesc. It is introduced by an instrumental tax¦m (preamble), which may be interspersed with interludes  often songs or dance melodies unconnected to the epic song proper. The verses are sequenced rather arbitrarily within large and elastic narrative episodes comprising numerous stanzas of different lengths, which may contain half-recited or parlato recitative phrases. The lªutar   in these regions, usually Gypsies  are the masters of Romanian epic song. Their performances, punctuated by dramatic and captivating gestures, were, and still are, much appreciated by the old people attending rural wedding banquets.

In the 1950s, one of the greatest masters of the East European epic ballads was the Gypsy Mihai Constantin, known as Lache Gªzaru, who hailed from a small village amid the sun-scorched dunes of southern Oltenia. Lache Gªzaru’s repertoire included some 40 long epics, as well as a vast store of individual songs.. His performances of the epic recitative style were exemplary, featuring melodies of a Middle Eastern cast that sometimes verged on speech. He interspersed his narrative with occasional instrumental passages that allowed him to collect his thoughts while the audience reflected on the story over another glass of wine. His technique emphasized storytelling rather than singing, and his stories were partly memorized, partly improvised on the spot. Here, Lache Gªzaru’s voice and fiddle are accompanied by a guitar with two strings removed, tuned D - F# - A - D. Such three- or four-stringed guitars apparently replaced the traditional cobzª or lute in Oltenia. At the time of this recording Gªzaru was 39 years old.","Mihai Constantin, known as Lache Gazaru Male solo, fiddle, Stan Gruia, guitar accompaniment",Male Voice; Fiddle; Guitar,Men,"Verde de-o mªlurª,

In former times they made most of the dance music in rural Romania, but gradually they have yielded ground to the fiddles and other modern instruments. Today bagpipes are unknown in parts of the country and their popularity is declining elsewhere. In Wallachia, however — notably in villages in the neighborhood of Ploie³ti (northern Wallachia), the source of this recording — the pipes are still much played. The “Ca la Breaza” is a couple dance of possibly southern Transylvanian origin, widespread in Wallachia. It is danced to many tunes having a common rhythmic formula whose rhythmic formula is 5+8/16, which nowadays is often blunted into ordinary 2/4:

The doinª in its classical southern form  rhythmically free, highly improvised, more or less in the manner of an oriental maq<m, with no concern about the number of melodic lines in a stanza, nor about the sequence of the verses  is still to be heard in the Oltenia region, nowadays mainly in the mouths of professional Gypsy musicians, though the doinª were common peasant property. The Oltenian Gypsy Maria Lªtªre·u, the acknowledged “queen of the living doinª singers,” is here accompanied by the state-supported Barbu Lªutaru Orchestra.

Doinª texts are commonly thought to be concerned mainly with melancholy and erotic themes; in fact, however, they often voice strong social protests, or as here, in this fond greeting to spring, convey a mixture of nostalgia and bright optimism.","Maria Lătărețu, folk orchestra",Female Voice; Folk Orchestra,Women,"Foaie verde mªrgªrit,

The most important wedding song, “C<ntecul miresei” (Song of the Bride), is sung as the bride bids farewell to her parents, her home, and her former life. The moment is solemn, the song poignant, and the participants often weep bitterly when it is sung (the bride, at any rate, is required to weep).

An agrarian landscape, the songs were song by men working in the fields, who also gathered in formalized singing groups. The style is characterized by the prominent role of bass-drone singers. Singing typical of northern Liguria.

Ceriana’s polyphonic singing typically features two solo voices — two tenors of differing vocal timbres — called the primo and the secondo. Generally, the secondo initiates the singing and the primo sings over his voice, each singer contributing his own particular ornamentation. The soloists’ clear, frequently fragmented melodic line contrasts with the dark, melodic immobility of the bass- drone singers, who support the soloists by singing the words on a single note, recalling a the drone of a bagpipe. At the conclusion of a phrase, some of the basses descend to the tonic. Interestingly, the townspeople refer to this style of drone singing as basso continuo. This particular performance is rendered more complex by the presence of an intermediate voice between the basses and the secondo part. The narrative ballad performed here, “A figlia du capitanu,” is one that was not included in Costantino Nigra’s famous 1888 collection.",Compagnia Sacco: male chorus,Male Voices,Men,"De chi l’è sta bèla figlia

This is one of the finest and most interesting of Alan Lomax’s Ceriana recordings, not only because of the splendid performance but also because this song is performed very differently today. Its melodic outline and use of the minor mode limit the opportunity for the basses to come in; thus the performance takes on the quality of soloists with accompanying support instead of choral polyphony. Under its better-known title, “La guerriera”, this song is widespread in northern Italy and in other European countries. Verses that follow the ones recorded here describe a series of trials to which the lover subjects the disguised girl in an attempt to force her to reveal her true nature. She resists, however, returning home as virginal as when she left.",Compagnia Sacco: male chorus,Male Voices,Men,"Paire de Catarina faijevà no ma piurà

1982,43.88,8.03,,,62553,,0:02:38,T202.8,Canto dell'albero,Cumulative Song,"This cumulative song used to be performed in June, the traditional month for weddings, on Pentecost Sunday. It was sung in accompaniment to the Festival of La Barca, described in the introduction and track 18. Although this particular song is still remembered, it is no longer often sung in full today, probably because of the difficulty of remembering the concatenations of the verses, which get longer and longer as the song progresses. It occurs elsewhere: A version with a different melody was collected in Cesnola, (Piemonte), and another in the area of Briga, not far from Baiardo. The beginning of the melody of the “Canto dell’albero” resembles the beginning of the second part of the “Canto della Barca”, suggesting a common origin for the two songs. 

The ceremony involves cutting a tall tree from the nearby woods and transporting it (formerly by an oxcart, today by truck) to the church square, where it is hoisted by means of musclepower. There is a place for it in the piazza where there is a hole, which is kept covered during the rest of the year. The top of the tree, previously cut off, is set into this hole — a practice symbolizing procreation. This formerly took place in the morning when people were on their way to Mass. Nowadays it takes place in the afternoon for the benefit of crowds of tourists. The few who still recall the song intone it while holding hands and circling slowly around the tree.

The singers of the Compagnia Sacco try to give the fullest possible version of this song, which is still in their repertoire today. It’s a vain attempt, for the simple reason that the song doesn’t really belong to the narrative genre but rather to that of the single-strophe lyrical love song, as evident from its eleven-syllable meter. The verses are arranged to form quatrains or sestinas, each complete in itself. The rather aggressive beginning — What have you gone and said, serpent tongue?” [i.e., deceiving to self and others)] that we hear in this recording today has been replaced by the more innocuous, “Where do you come from, serpent tongue?” ","Compagnia Sacco, male chorus",Male Voices,Men,"Co ti èi andaita a di o lenga serpentina

This is undoubtedly the most popular song for dancing in Valle d’Aosta. The words, in Provençal, were probably adapted to a preexisting melody, perhaps a ronde or farandole in 6/8 time and spanning the interval of a sixth, whose simplicity facilitated memorization, and hence wide distribution. The same motif occurs in another song from the Piedmontese valleys bordering France “En passant le Mont-Cenis, vient de la neige” (“Crossing Mount Cenis [on the border between Piedmont and France], it snows”). The tune resembles “La Marion sur un pommier” (“Marion in an Apple Tree,” a typical Savoyard song, according to Julien Tiersot).","Pacifico Perret, Giuseppe Gérard, accordions, tamborine, mixed chorus",Male Voice; Accordions; Tamborine; Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Dansa pa deussù lo fèn

For untold centuries, the pastoral people in the Alpine center of Europe have gone with their animals up into the mountain pastures for the summer. Often this was the task of the young men and women together. In the green meadows and during the bright days of the Alpine summer, were made the marriages of these independent people. 

One day along a road in the French-speaking Valle d’Aosta, I recorded the beginning of this ancient summer pilgrimage. The herd of cows was moving along the road of social precedence. At the head stepped the most productive milker in the herd, at her throat the biggest of the bronze bells and between her horns a high garland of flowers and shining ornaments. A few paces behind came her three court attendants with somewhat smaller bells and less lavish crowns. Then came small garlands and bells of middle tone and after them, the ruck of heifers with little bells ringing. With no other central plan than the stately rhythm of the walkers, this whole orchestra of bells, swinging against the bovine dewlaps, weaves a heterophony that far outdoes the calculations of Cage and Bortolotto. — Alan Lomax",Bells on cattle,Cattle Bells,,,Alan Lomax,1954,Smithsonian Folkways,"Italian Folk Music, Vol 1: Piedmont, Emelia, Lombardy.

They play with a singing tone, a loose and vibrant rhythm, and a confidence in themselves as an orchestra which marks an old and sure tradition. Village bands playing in this style can be found in Central Europe all the way east into Central Russia, but I myself have heard no performance more surefooted and charming than that of rural Piedmont. —Alan Lomax

The monferrina is one of the best known dances of northern Italy and the one most associated with old Piedmont. The hilly region between the Po River and the Apennine mountains of Liguria and Piedmont was known historically as Monferrato and was subdivided into lower Monferrato (between the Tanaro and Po rivers) and upper Monferrato (south of the Tanaro). Renowned for grape-growing, the region also produced a rich folk culture of songs and dances associated with the agricultural round, above all with the grape harvest and with taverns. Here is a classic example in both text and tune of this traditional circle dance. The first section in 2/4 time accompanies the spasso, in which couples walk arm and arm with a jumping step while singing; the second part in 6/8 time is the balletto, in which the dancers face each other. 

Tonco, in Asti, is celebrated for its Festival of the Pitu (turkey), held in the piazza on the last Sunday of Carnival, during which young men on horseback compete to see who can detach the head of the pitu hung from a rope on a pole in the piazza. The turkey is a symbolic sacrifice whose burlesque last will and testament in dialect rhymes is read during the festivities.  

La Bersagliera di Tonco is one of the oldest bands in Piedmont and is still active today. It was founded in 1894 by Pietro Stobbione, a baker, and Giuseppe Cantino, a postal supervisor, both clarinetists. By 1900, the band had 16 members, thanks to the sponsorship of the district physician, Luigi Ferrando. In 1901, it was decreed by statute that the players should wear the uniform of the Bersaglieri. When its personnel reached 36, La Bersagliera split into a band and an orchestra and after World War I, it became quite well known throughout Italy. Currently, it has about 30 members. Its present director, trumpeter Bruno Bezzo, is the author of many arrangements and was present in 1954 when these recordings were made.","La Bersagliera band: Bruno Bezzo (trumpet), Camillo Spina (trombone), Luigi Ragazzi (trombone), Felice Sampietro (clarinet), Enrico Velio (tuba); with Dante Stobbione (violin), Giuseppe Maffei (accordion), Adriana Allara, Vittorina Allara, Gemma Meda, Giuliana Meda (female voices), and a mixed chorus",Mixed Voices; Trombones; Clarinet; Double Bass; Violin; Accordion,Mixed adults,"O bundì bundì bundì

The heat of your fury
disturbed your heart
and, even seeing you afflicted,
the angel consoled you. 
In Bethlehem you were sad
and afflicted and anxious,
but then before the Kings
you were consoled. 
To Egypt in great sorrow,
you travel with deep fatigue,
caring for the holy babe
and his suffering mother.
You are the mirror of saints,
and king of chastity,
crown of martyrs
and piety of men.
The Brothers of the Dawn
beg you with devotion
to give us eternal grace,
and then salvation.
And in heaven there is neither male nor female saint
who has the word of the righteous Joseph,
for he holds in his holy arms
the king of heaven, as this is He.
Let’s go and meet him
and the flowers on his rod
our patriarch Saint Joseph. ",Alan Lomax with Jeannette Bell,1952,Westminster,"Spanish Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

This secular-derived type of part- singing has survived only in the northern provinces of Castagniccia and Orezza, although it seems to have been more widespread in the past.

A paghjella is always sung by three male singers: the seconda (leading voice), the bassa, a low voice that gives the bass notes of the main chords (tonic, sub- dominant, dominant), and the terza (upper voice). The terza’s unusual metallic timbre and ribuccata (florid melismas) enrich the melody. The repertory of cantu chjesale (sacred or church songs, often performed by lay confraternities), includes  sung masses in Latin or in Corsican — messa di i morti (the requiem mass), messa  di i vivi (mass for the living), and messa di suffragiu (mass for the repose of the soul). This paghjella is a polyphonic motet sung in the Catholic Church of Rusio during the  benediction of the Holy Sacrament (it is based on “Pange Lingua” by St. Thomas Aquinas.)","Jules-François Rocchi, Pierre-Marie Oppisi, J.B.

The extraordinarily expressive polyphonic interweaving of the voices takes precedence over the meter of the text. Several polyphonic procedures are employed — predominantly parallelism. At times the often strongly melismatic melody is accompanied by a held note, or drone. A single voice doubles the melody at the octave, and the fourth tone is always augmented. The tonal range encompasses a ninth (taking into account the range of all the voices). This type of polyphony has vanished in Feroleto, together with the women who used to perform it, but is recalled with great nostalgia by the older people of the town.","Antonia, Maria, Michellina Pingitore, Anelina Sarro, Maria Stella Molinaro",5 Female Voices,Women,"Brunetta brunettella amore arma gentile

The last tonnara, at Pizzo, ceased operating in 1963. “U leva leva” was sung during the levata, or raising of the net, the part of the fishing immediately preceding the mattanza, or butchery, of the tuna. Driven by barriers made by the nets, the fish, after going through several intermediate “chambers,” entered the so-called camera della morte or death chamber, the only one with a net at the bottom. When their number was deemed  sufficient, their every way of exit was barred and the raising of the net began. The men lifted it from the bottom with the help of a capstan, causing the death chamber enclosure to become smaller and smaller. They then quickly harpooned the fish as they emerged from the water and heaved them onto the barge. The laborious task was accompanied by the cadence of a responsorial song, in which a chorus answers a soloist, who sets  the rhythm of the circular pace around the capstan and hence of the work. The singing here comprises two rhythmic/ melodic sections. In the first section the leader intones two distinct melodies. The second section answers to the need to sustain an ever-increasing physical effort, reflecting the growing difficulty of raising the net imprisoning the tuna. Here the leader also intones two melodies. The chorus, respecting the responsorial principle virtually throughout, answers the leader’s rhythmic/melodic model without introducing any variations of its own, the occasional overlapping between leader and chorus not counting as variations.
 
The repertoire of the 1954 Vibo Marina tonnara was reconstructed for this recording. The fishermen put out to sea and mimed the levata and part of the mattanza, turning around a capstan and weaving their work procedures into their formalized musical performance for the benefit of the two ethnomusicologists. Lomax recalled:

I remember one day when I set up the battered old Magnacord on a tuna-fishing barge, fifteen miles out on the glassy blue Mediterranean. No tuna had come into the underwater trap for months, and the fishermen had not been paid for almost a year. Yet they bawled out their capstan chanteys as if they were actually hauling in a rich catch, and a certain point slapped their bare feet on the deck, simulating exactly the dying convulsions of a dozen tuna. Then, on hearing the playback, they applauded their own performance like so many opera singers.","Rocco Cannovino, Salvatore Canduci, Onofrio Lopresti, team of fisherman",3 Male Voices,Men,"Tiramu…

goes around my street
saying he loves me
more than his mother;
this is life,
the one who promises the most
forgets the soonest.
I married a cute little dwarf,
just for a good laugh
I raised his bed up really high
and he couldn’t get up to it.
And coming down
he broke his nose.
I married a cute little dwarf
and just for a good laugh
I tossed him into the well.

early 1970s with the closing of the last Sicilian sulfur mines. The industry’s exposure of
workers to noxious fumes, the low wages, and use of child labor had drawn universal
opprobrium. To ease their terror and fatigue, miners sang songs lamenting the dismal
conditions in the mines, represented as a hell on earth. Song texts abounded in appeals
to God and the saints, and expressions of relief and gratitude at returning to the light of
day. The miners also frequently adopted the song repertoires and styles of peasants and
carters. During rest periods — corresponding to main meals — they would perform
canzuni for solo voice to the accompaniment of Jew’s harp or chorus. They also sang
during gatherings at the taverns that solaced their harsh lives.

This song is a complaint about the loneliness and degradation of the miners, forgotten
and ignored by all, even by the saints, but not by the beloved, the sole ray of hope amid
such desolation. The vocal style is melismatic and rhythmically free. The Jew’s harp
maintains the tonic as a drone, its accompaniment characterized by rhythmic
expressiveness, above all in the brief instrumental interludes between the couplets and
the concluding cadences.","Rocco Meli, Elio Perconte, marranzano jews harp",Male Voice; Marranzano (Mouth Harp),Men,"(a) Mi scuordu, mi scurdà, scurdatu sugnu,

Carters sang while driving their merchandise and in the fùnnachi (warehouses) where they stopped for refreshment and challenged one another to contests of vocal virtuosity Today, the elaborately carved and decorated Sicilian carts are no longer used for work, but older drivers continue to engage in singing competitions. The basic metrical form of the Sicilian canzuna (and indeed of Italian folk poetry in general) is a one-stanza octave of alternately rhymed hendecasyllabic lines (though some have six — as here — or ten, or less often, four or twelve lines). Lyrics may be about love or disdain, the carter’s trade, or religious devotion. The melody, modal with sporadic chromaticisms (sharps and flats), is binary. The rhythmically free virtuoso performance features pronounced melismatic ornamentation. In this recording, we hear the driver singing as he guides the reins of his horse. The six-line text echoes a typical folk motif: the visit to the house of the sweetheart to give her a handkerchief as a pledge of love. The melody, with its descending outline, has the range of an octave. Cadences on V and I correspond to the words of the couplet.","Domenico Lanza, jingling reins",Male Voice; Jingling Reins,Men,"Assira cci passavu ddi l’amuri,

Seasonal workers would organize themselves into teams and were paid by the basket. The number of salinari (salt workers) per team varied from a minimum of eight to a maximum of 16, depending on the size of the salt works. The harvest was divided into three cycles, broken by 15 days of inactivity. Work began before dawn, between two and three in the morning, and continued until four in the afternoon, with pauses for meals at 9:00 A.M. and midday. It was directed by a curatulu or mastru i salina (superintendent), who would designate a trustee to measure the number of baskets of salt gathered. 

The work was carried out under a baking sun, sometimes during the relentless blowing of the sirocco from Africa. To make it bearable, the workers sang as they carried the 40 - pound baskets. Singing raised morale and increased production, since the workers were paid by the piece. By singing out the count they could also avoid being cheated by the padrone. The count normally went from one to 24 and was based principally on untranslatable jargon expressions. Many of the terms are variations on the word sale (salt) — salalina, and salannui, for example. The song rhythms are regular and driving and the singing style tends toward shouting. The descending melodies range within a sixth and tend to be pentatonic. 

The melody is a lament pressed out of the body of the singer as the basket grows heavier and heavier on his shoulders. One of the oldest, most primitive wailing tunes of the Mediterranean, sung in a pinched and high falsetto voice, which permits the singers to ornament and decorate the melodies with shakes, growling sobs, and prolonged groans at the end of the line — very African.... At the end the labor contractor came up and took his cut from what we paid the men. — Alan Lomax, notebook, 1954","Alternating male solos: Alberto Piacentino, Salvatore Frigerio",2 Male Voices,Men,"First song:

There's a mill there, and a good old lady in it/the son of Estepa arrives there, asking for a bed for the night,//for him and four others who were with him/food for them and their horses.//The poor old lady said to him, ""I'd give it to you if I had it/but my situation is so bad//that they're throwing me out of the mill, because I can't/ pay the rent.""//The man from Estepona went out, and went to the rich man/and demanded 1000 pesetas, and gave them to the old woman.//If Pernales had never left Andalusia/he would not have died so young, nor would his parents be weeping for him today,//Because there they knew very well the ground he trod on/and how he mocked his persecutors.

He furnished fine texts and tunes for more than two hundred folk songs, including many Child ballads, and his reper toire of erotic lyrics was extraordinary. Here he sings, in the classic fashion of the Norfolk balladeer, one of the many ballads concerning the amorous adventures of cobblers and the sexual symbolism of their tools. James Reeves comments that the regard for the cobbler’s awl, with which the cobbler makes the sewing holes in leather, as phallic “has been commonplace since at least the Middle Ages.” In his book on English folk song, A. L. Lloyd used this song as a typical example of English eroticism. Harry Cox himself enjoyed singing the song in female company, but only after he had first been granted the go-ahead. George Gardiner collected two versions of another cobbler song in Hampshire, about which Reeves made his com mentary.

Cecil Sharp came across a version of this same song in North Carolina and John Harrington Cox found one Ohio. In it, a cobbler’s boy who has obtained his freedom meets a pretty girl and regrets that he has lost most of his cobbler’s wax:

I am a merry cobbler and lately gained my freedom,
I set my affections on her, a fair young damsel pretty,
Must I use my awl for my derry-derry-down,
Must I use my awl for my dear-o?
Ring-ting-ting, ring-a~ting-a-ting,
O you are my dear-o.

Five pounds I have in gold, and that is all my treasure,
Besides an old greatcoat and a jolly bit of leather.
O zounds, I’ve lost my wax, I dunno what’s become of it,
It’s no use to swear or vex, for here lies some of it.

Interestingly, “ring-a-ding-ding” still has connotations of sexual innuendo in the United States (it occurs memorably in Billy Wilder’s movie, The Apartment). Another American cobbler song, a melancholy survival entitled “Peg an’ Awl,” deals solely with the problems brought by the Industrial Revolution (see Alan Lomax’s Folk Songs of North America [New York: Doubleday, 1960], p. 283).

They’ve invented a new machine, peg an’ awl,
The prettiest little thing you ever seen,
I'll throw away my pegs, my pegs, my pegs, my awl.

Harry Cox’s tune exhibits, with particular clarity, the modal quality found in many British traditional songs.",Harry Cox,Male Voice,Men,"As I was a-walking, one morning in May,
I met a pretty fair maid, her gown it was gay.
I stepp-ed up to her, and back she did fall.
She want to be played with the long peggin’ awl.

I said, “Pretty fair maid, will you travel with me,
Unto foreign countries, strange things for to see?
And I will protect you, what e’er may befall
And follow your love,” with his long peggin’ awl.

Then home to her parents she then went straightway,
And unto her mother these words she did say,
“I’ll follow my truelove, whate’er may befall,
I'll follow my love, with his long peggin’ awl.”

“O daughter, o daughter, how can you say so?
For young men are false, you very well know,
They’ll tell you fine things, and the devil and all,
And leave you big-bellied, with their long peggin’ awl.”

In Italy, where chestnuts are a main crop, the songs of the chestnut harvest paint a picture of a wanton fall saturnalia. But perhaps no chestnut song can match the madcap delight of this frolicking ballad and its abandoned refrain. The tune often occurs as a Morris dance and as a Country Dance, also in the Devonshire ballad called “Jack of All Trades,” in “Calder Fair,” and in Samuel Lover’s famous “Low-backed Car.” Lover took the tune from Bunting, who recorded it from an Irish harper in 1792. The text was familiar to broadside printers, but Cyril Poacher has improved it. The Rev. Sabine Baring Gould printed “word toned down somewhat” in Songs of the West.  Most English collectors have come across this song and it is also much used as a dance tune, for both ritual Morris and social Country Dances.","Cyril Poacher, melodeon, male chorus ",Male Voice; Male Voices,Men,"Now come all you jovial fellows, come listen to my song,
It is a little ditty and it won’t contain you long.
It’s of a fair young damsel, she lived down in Kent,
Arose one summer’s morning, she a-nutting went.
With my fal-lal, to my ral-tal-lal,
Whack-fol-the-dear-ol-day.
And what few nuts that poor girl had,
She threw them all away.

Now it’s of a brisk young farmer, was ploughing of his land,        
He called unto his horses, to bid them gently stand,
As he sit down upon his plough, all for a song to sing,
His voice was so melodious, it made the valleys ring.

It’s of this fair young damsel, she was nutting in the wood,
His voice was so melodious, it charmed her as she stood.
[In that lonely wood] she could no longer stay,
And what few nuts she had, poor girl, she threw them all away.

She then came to young Johnny, as he sit on his plough.
She said, “Young man, I really feel I cannot tell you how.”
He took her to some shady broom, and there he laid her down.
Said she, “Young man, I think I feel the world go round and round.”

[Additional verses: Now, come all you young women, this warning by me take,
If you should a-nuttin’ go, please get home in time,
For if you should stay too late, to hear the ploughboy sing,
You might have a young farmer, to nurse up in the spring.]",Alan Lomax; Peter Kennedy,1954,Caedmon Records,"English Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

The “blue” songs of Scotland are seldom “dirty” or unpleasant. They take a frank delight in sex, attaching no penalty to it. Nor do they condemn the maid when, some months later, her belly grows heavy and round. However, this song is certainly known in the Scottish parts of Northern Ireland; Robin Morton heard it from John Maguire in Co. Fermanagh, not to this tune but nevertheless to a similar jig tune in 6/8 rhythm. This is one of many songs about tavern wenches in the spirit of Robert Burns’s Merry Muses of Caledonia, in which it might well have been included. 

The great ballad singer Jeannie Robertson, a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, is featured on the Portraits series in The Alan Lomax Collection on Rounder Records.",Jeannie Robertson,Female Voice,Women,"I come to a cross and I met a wee lass,

And we never did rise till the cock it did crow.
And it’s glass after glass we merrily did toast,
To the bonnie wee lassie who never said no.

[This bonnie wee lassie, she being slow in drink]
The landlady opened the door and come in with a smile;
She lifted a chair with freedom and air,
“Here’s health to the lass who can jig it in style.”

“To cheer up his spirits, I doubt they are low,
For it’s not what you do, bring a bottle or two,

Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary for Jan 2, 1666, the year of the Fire of London: “In perfect pleasure I was to hear Mrs. Knipp, the actress, sing, and especially her little Scotch song of Barbry Allen.” In the eighteenth century, poet and novelist Goldsmith was moved to tears when an old dairymaid sang it for him. Generations of Britons, and especially Americans, apparently agreed with a mountaineer friend of mine who said that,  “It made the ha’r rise on my head to hear it sung.” 

One might fairly conclude, if popular ballads deal with important psychological patterns, that “Barbara Allen” contains a theme central to the emotional life of Great Britain and, even more, America. The story could not be simpler. A young man is dying of love. He calls for his girl and asks forgiveness and mercy. She scorns and leaves him and he dies. When she hears of his death, she dies of remorse — and in America, so does her mother. It seems to me that the most obvious interpretation here is the most cogent: that is, the revenge and subsequent guilt of a proud, cold, and possibly injured, woman, which would be felt in different ways by male and female listeners. This explanation fits the history of the sexual pattern in recent times in the English-speaking world.

Robert Graves proposed an idea that may account for the origin of the song. He saw Barbara Allen as a witch who is killing a man by magic. He begs for mercy, but she persists in her cruelty and then, as often transpires in such tales, she is killed by her own wickedness. In this version, the offer of gifts to Barbara and the lines that have her laughing when she sees the corpse suggest that Graves may well have been right.",Jessie Murray,Female Voice,Women,"In Scotland I was born and bred,
In Scotland I was dwellin.
I fell in love with a pretty fair maid,
And her name was Barbara Allen.

I coorted her for seven long year,
Till I could coort no longer.
I fell seek and very seek,
And ah sent for Barbara Allen.

Barbara Allen she was sent for,
To the house where she was dwellin.
And as she drew the curtain back,
“Young man, I think you’re dyin.”

“Dyin, dear, what do you mean?
One kiss from you will cure me.”
“One kiss from me you never shall have,
Though you’re dyin, dyin, dyin.”

He turned his face back to the wa,
And his back tae Barbara Allen.
“Adieu, adieu, my kind friends aa,
But be kind to Barbara Allen.”

And make it long and narrow.

In Scotland and on the continent, the body of the dead girl is found by a harper who makes strings for his harp from her hair. When he plays this instrument at the court of her father, the human harp accuses the wicked sister and she is brought to justice. 

In one of these, a broadside that appeared in 1656, the miller makes a viol of the drowned girl’s body. In some other versions it is a fiddle or a harp, but this musical instrument motif is absent in most of the English and American copies. The story is widely distributed in Slavic folklore, and may have originated there. Archer Taylor (Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 17, p. 238 ff.) argues that the ballad form may have come into Great Britain from Scandinavia before 1600, but Bronson (p.143) disagrees.

John Strachan (1875-1958), a Lowlands farmer, and Scotland’s finest male ballad-singer at the time, was aged 76 when he recorded for Alan Lomax.",John Strachan,Male Voice,Men,"There were two sisters lived in a glen,

Mrs. Cronin was old and feeble when we met her. Indeed, we had to hold the microphone close to her lips to register her voice at all, but her sensitive and graceful matching of verse and melody throughout is a model for modern singers. 

Modern collectors have rarely found the ballad itself in such a complete form, although the full story was once widely popular. Child prints 13 texts and Bronson 24, .with tunes.

The present form omits to explain that “The Lass 0’Roch Royal,” bearing his illegitimate child in her arms, comes to Gregory’s castle to ask for her lover’s help. Mrs. Cronin begins with the conversation between the girl and Gregory’s mother. In fact, she dwells so much upon this passage that the ballad is turned half way into a lyric.

 “Lord Gregory” has been often reported in America, but rarely more than the “who will shoe my feet” stanzas occur, sometimes as a lyric song or embedded in other folk pieces. Perhaps this is an example of a ballad dwindling away to a fragment. On the other hand, it seems more likely that this stanza series has wandered into many songs.",Elizabeth Cronin,Female Voice,Women,"“I am a king’s daughter,

On the one hand, the song seems to portray a market girl summing up her day’s receipts in coins. On the other, it is perhaps another instance in Irish folk song of an encounter with a feminine symbol — in this case a revolutionary one — of the spirit of oppressed Ireland. The song is also called “The Spanish Lady” (the title that was used by Herbert Hughes for his piano setting of the tune), the Irish equivalent of the English song, “No, John, No.” An American version is “A Paper of Pins.”

Seamus Ennis is the great Irish folk song collector, scholar, and performer.",Séamus Ennis,Male Voice,Men,"As I walked through Dublin city, at the hour of twelve at night,
Who should I see but a maiden beauty, combing her hair with a four-pronged pike.
Turry-idle-ido-dido-dido,                          
Turry-idle-ido-dido-day.                

As I walked again through Dublin, on the same or another night,
Who should I see but the same fair maiden, counting her cash by the candlelight.

[Additional verses: I says, “Fair maid, I come you a-courting, your fine features for to win,
If you’ll kindly entertain me, some dark night I’ll call again.”

She says, ""Kind sir, you've come me a-courting, my fine features for to win,
And if I kindly entertain you, you may never call again.”

She sent me very tight all over, including the crown of my old hat,
I pulled out my “pouse” revolver and let fly a terrible shot.

When I heard the answer that she made me, 1 called her a bloody bean.
“Don’t you know to whom you’re talking?  I am Linnehan from Lisheen.”

“I have gold and! have money, I have cattle and I have land,
I have ships upon the ocean ready to sail at my command.” 

“1 don’t want your gold or money, I don't want your cattle and land,
I don’t want your ships from the ocean, all I want is a fine young man.”

Courtin’ women is foolish folly, and marryin’ women is just the same.
Courtin’ women when they’re not willin’ is like throwin’ water against the stream.]",Alan Lomax; Robin Roberts,1951,Caedmon Records,"Irish Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"
9390,53.34,-6.26,,,50250,,0:00:28,7B38.B1; CHB5A2.7,Captain Wedderbum's Courtship,,"Very often printed in British songbooks in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, this rather risqué riddling ballad became particularly popular in Ireland and thence was probably carried to New England, where it also became fairly widespread.

The theme of the ingenious suitor is an ancient one. It forms the plot of many fairy stories, and occurs in the Arabian Nights and in Greek collections. Again, in this ballad form we encounter the pagan notion that a woman encountered alone and unprotected is fair game and must expect to yield to her captor, unless she is wittier than he. The lusty keeper makes his demands upon the Captain’s daughter. She counters by asking a group of three riddles, then a group of four, which, according to ancient courting custom, he must be able to answer correctly or give her up. Apparently the lady is pleased and impressed by his success, for the ballad concludes:

Little did this lady think that morning when she raise,
That this was for to be the last o’ a’ her maiden days.
But there’s na into the king’s realm to be found a blither twa,
And now she’s Mrs. Wedderburn, and she lies to the wa’.

Again it is a question whether the story form was imposed upon the riddling sequence or whether the reverse was the case. The well-known riddling song version: “I Gave My Love a Cherry,” found in the Southern Appalachian Mountains by Cecil Sharp (FSSA 2, 190) and the English and New England “I Gave My Love an Apple” clearly have emerged from it. Still another variant found in England has the macaronic Latin refrain “Perrie Merrie Dictum Dominic.” Child has three, and Bronson, 26 variants of this song.",Séamus Ennis,Male Voice,Men,"Thomas Moran sings:
A gentleman’s daughter rode down a narrow lane,
Meeting with Young Woodburn, the keeper of the game.
He says unto his servant man, “If only for the law,
I would have this fair one in the bed, and she’d lie next the wa’.”

“Go ’way, go ’way, young man,” she says, “and do not trouble me.
Before you lie one night with me, you’ll answer questions three.
You must get for me three dishes, suppose I ate them all,
Before you and I in one bed lie, at either stock or wall.”

“You must get me for me breakfast a cherry without a stone,
You must get me for me dinner a bird without a bone.
You must get me for me supper a bird without a gall,
Before you and I in one bed lie at either stock or wall.”

“When the cherry’s in the blossom, it also has no stone,
And when the bird is in the egg, it surely has no bone.
The dove she is a gentle bird — she flies without a gall,
Or so you and I in one bed lie, and you’ll lie next the wall,”

“Go ’way, go ’way, young man,” she says, “and do not me perplex,
Before you lie one night with me, you’ll answer questions six.
Six questions you must answer me, and I’ll set forth them all,
O before you lie one night with me at either stock or wall.”

“O then, what is rounder than a ring, or higher than a tree?
Or what is worse than women’s chide? What’s deeper than the sea?
What bird sings best? What tree buds first? And where does the dew first fa’?
Before you and I in one bed lie at either stock or wall.”

“Well the globe is rounder than a ring. Heaven’s higher than a tree.
The devil is worse than women’s chide. Hell’s deeper than the sea.
The thrush sings best, the haik [oak] buds first, and on it the dew first fall,
Before you and I in one bed lie, and you lie next the wall.”

“You must get for me some winter fruit, that in December grew.
You must get for me a silk mantle that weft had ne’er ran through.
A sparrow’s horn, a priest unborn, to join us both in twa,
So you and I in one bed lie, and you lie next the wall.”

O my father he has winter fruit, that in September grew,
My mother has a silk mantle that weft had ne’er ran through.
A sparrow’s horn is easy got, for there’s one on every claw,
And Damocles is a priest unborn; he’ll join us both (spoken:) in twa.",Peter Kennedy,1952,Caedmon Records,"The Folk Songs of Britain: Volume IV, The Child Ballads, I. Caedmon Records TC 1145, 1961","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

It is thorned, it is sprinkled — it is compassed all around,
It is thorned, it is sprinkled, and it isn’t easy found.

The guild brothers were bound together by elaborate rituals, by special imagery, and by their songs. This song is about the weavers’ guild and refers to the famous mechanical engineer Joseph Marie Jacquard (1752–1834), inventor of the loom that bears his name. Jacquard lived in Lyon, situated “at the confluence of the Saône and the Rhône” (mentioned in this song), and his invention contributed to the prosperity of the town. The Roman goddess Minerva, renowned for her skill in weaving, was the patroness of artisans, particularly weavers; since it is recounted in Ovid’s Metamorphosis (VI: 5–54) that she turned the mortal maiden Arachne into a spider for daring to vie with her in that art.

The title, “The Web of the Virgin,” indicates that just as the spider weaves its web, so the love of the Virgin weaves a chain that links the hearts of all the compagnons.","Male leader, male chorus",Male Voice; Male Voices,Men,"Dans l’art brillant où Jacquard fut grand maître, Or il advint qu’un honnête aspirant

568,54.59,-5.93,,,17271,Old audio file # T5465R03,0:02:06,7B36.B10,The Bold English Navvy,Ballad,"This song was recorded during two all-night sessions in Belfast in the summer of 1952. The men sang first, downing bottles of stout, and it was not until far into the night that the young tinker girls, who scarcely ever sang in public, took the courage to perform. As the men lay drowsing, the girls began to compete with each other, grasping the microphone stand with both hands and singing in turns with unrelenting intensity, until dawn began to lighten the campsite. Many of the girls had babies in arms, wrapped in their shawls, and managed to breastfeed them even while recording. 

Their distinctive style of singing — one could call it “crooning”— is common to the English and Welsh Gypsies and the Scots and Irish tinkers (or “travelers”) in all parts of Britain, but in Ireland it is most strongly marked. The singers employ a nasal tone, prolong and dwell on the consonants, often rolling the opening syllables with an “Oh,” and sometimes jumble their texts and tunes, just as they often do with their speech and cant, in order to make it less intelligible to non travelers. There is undoubtedly a connection here with the crooning style of the early film actors and recording artists, many of whom came from groups of traveling entertainers. Other versions of this song, titled “The Kettle Smock,” were previously collected by Cecil Sharp and Henry Hammond in England, and by Gavin Greig in Scotland, where it was known as “The Courtin’ Coat.” Versions have been recorded from Jimmy McBeath, the Scottish supertramp, and from John Stickle from the Isle of Unst in Shetland.

The singer, Lal Smith, was 17 at the time of this recording",Lal Smith,Male Voice,Men,"I’m a bold English navvy that fought on the line,
The first place I met was Newcastle-on-Tyne.
I bein’ tired, sick, and weary from working all day,
To a cot down by the hillside I’m making my way.

I first had me supper and then had a shave,
For courtin’ this fair maid I highly prepared.
Th’ould stars in the sky as the moon it shone down,
And I hit for the road with my navvy boots on.

I knocked at my love’s window, my knock she did know,
And out of her slumber she wokened so slow
I knocked there again, and she said, “Is that John?”
And I quickly replied, “ With my navvy boots on.”

O she opened the window and then let me in,
’Twas into her bedroom she landed me then.
Th’ould night it being cold and the blankets rolled on,
And I slept there all night with my navvy boots on.

[Verses omitted: O, then early next morning at the dawn of the day,

Said I to my true love, “It’s time to go away.”
“Sleep down, sleep down, you know you’ve done wrong,
For to sleep here all night with your navvy boots on.”

O he bent down his head with a laugh and a smile,
Saying, “What could I do, love, in that little while?
And I know if I done it, I done it in fun,
And I’ll do it again with my navvy boots on.”

O, then six months being over, and seven at the least,
When this pretty fair maid got stout round the waist,
For eight months being over, when nine comes along,
And she handed him a young son with his navvy boots.

“So come all you pretty fair maids, take a warning,” she said,
“Don’t ever leave a navvy go into your bed,
For when he’ll get warm and think upon yon
Sure, he’ll jump on your bones with his navvy boots on.]",Peter Kennedy,1952,Caedmon Records,"The Folksongs of Britain, Volume II: Songs of Seduction. Caedmon Records. TC-1143, 1961","Copy in Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"
789,54.54,-6.7,,,17271,,0:01:55,7B38.A3,The False Knight On The Road,Fisherman's Song; Narrative Song; Spirit Song,"Story passed on by old fishermen, tells of a knight who is an emissary of the devil, a specter that inhabits the road and kills any who encounter him, song dialogue is a test of a child to see if he is prepared for the ultimate end.

The false knight of Child’s title the devil. This ballad explains how to overcome him. 

Duncan McPhee, aged 19, proved to be somewhat shy about singing his Scottish stanzas. Even though he was among his peers, the other teenage travelers at the Perthshire raspberry picking camp. Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy, amid shouts of “Come on, Duncan!” had to appeal to the company as a whole to use their group coercion. This eventually involved picking him up bodily and roasting Duncan threateningly over the flames of the campfire. It sometimes happens that collectors, in order to rescue important ballads and preserve our musical heritage, have to resort to somewhat drastic methods. The tune is that of  “The Flowers of Edinburgh.” ",Frank Quinn,Male Voice,Men,"Duncan Macphee (spoken): It’s supposed to be a small boy going to school. He was met on the road by the devil — supposed to be. And the devil was wanting the share of his provisions. 

“O what’s that on your back?”
Cries the false knight upon the road.
“ Sure that’s the bundles an’ my books,”
 Cries the wee lad and still he stood.

Etc., as before:
“O will you give me share?”
“ O I canna gi’e you share.”
        
“O what’n sheep an’ cattle’s that?”
“Sure that’s my fathers noo an’ mine”

The second version on this track was recorded three years later in Northern Ireland. An old fisherman told the singer Frank Quinn that “the knight was some kind of emissary of the devil, some sort of a spectre or like, that inhabited a certain part of the road. It was fatal for a person to move confrontin’ this thing, and this dialogue was a test of the child — to see if he was well fortified for the ultimate end.”  This story of encountering the Devil, of defying him, and often of routing him by saying God’s name, is an old one. “Sure everybody knows if you stand in the one place without moving, when the devil meets you, he’ll do you no harm. And this wee fellow had the heart of a Christian, the staff for the land, and the boat for the sea”

Bertrand Bronson, who published 12 variants of this ballad, thought that the tunes all had a common ancestor, probably rooted in Scotland; whence it spread to the United States and Nova Scotia (p. 34). Indeed, our Irish informant had his song from his Scottish grandfather who came to live at Coalisland on Lough Neagh, when he was a boy. In those days Robbie Burns was the favorite poet of the district, and Quinn’s grandfather, who read Ovid among other good literature, taught him other ballads, such as “Lord Randall” (Child 12) and “Edward” (Child 13), also imported from Scotland. Frank Quinn’s tune is similar to “The Uist Tramping Song” collected by Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser in the Hebrides.

“How will you go by land?”
Said the knight on the road.
“With a strong staff in my hand,” 
 Said the child as he stood.

And he stood and he stood,
And ’twere well he stood.
With a strong staff in my hand,
Said the child as he stood.        

“How will you go by sea?” 
“With a good boat under me.”
“Methinks I hear a bell.”
“Aye, it’s ringing you to hell.”",Sean O'Boyle,1954,Caedmon Records,"The Folk Songs of Britain: Volume IV, The Child Ballads, I. Caedmon Records TC 1145, 1961","Copy in Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

This overlapping manner of singing, called kan ha diskan, is common in the hilly regions of central Brittany. As the tempo of the song increases, the voices of the two singers take on the quality of two instruments. Such singing is the preferred accompaniment to the Breton gavottes performed by the farmers after hard work or by actors dancing in the Christmas mystery plays. Loeiz Ropars played a leading role in the revival of kan ha diskan and the traditional gavotte, the national dance of Brittany. Every Saturday evening, you can find festoù-noz (nightime dance sessions) throughout Brittany. Thousands of people, young or old, poor or rich, dance traditional repertories for entertainment. Musicians and singers are invited to play and sing the scores of melodies that have been spectacularly revived. There are festivals featuring concerts, dances, and competitions, particularly in summer.

This version comes from ballad singer John Stickle (1875-1957), who worked as a cooper at Baltasound on Unst and later at Lerwick making barrels for the herring fisheries, which in his day, like oil today, was centered on Shetland. In his spare time he was fiddler for local dances and weddings as well as singing and reciting at parties and concerts. Interestingly his family were descended from a German whose ship was wrecked on Unst and was rescued still holding onto his fiddle in the 1770s. His son, Robert, Stickle's grandfather, inherited his father's ability and was recognized as the best player in all Shetland ""that was in the first position"". He was supposed to have been press-ganged with his fiddle where his only duty was to play and to have composed many of the tunes, which are still popular in Shetland today. It was while his descendant was singing nonsense songs to Patrick Shaw that he came out with this fragment, remarking, “Have you every heard anything so silly as this? He had no idea of its meaning nor its rarity and significance to ballad scholars. Shaw at once thrilled to the realization that he was hearing the long-lost tune of the ballad of King Orfeo. The singer, however, could not understand why the collector became so excited. ",John Stickle,Male Voice,Men,"Will you come in into our ha’,

At that time there were still many dance halls where the Auvergnats of Paris would gather to enjoy their regional dances, drink red wine, and speak their local language.
 
The relationship between Paris and the Auvergne played an important role in the development of French popular music. During the nineteenth century, the Auvergnats of Paris used to dance together to the sound of the cabrette (from Occitan cabra — “goat”), the traditional bagpipe of south-middle France (see track 17). When the Eiffel Tower was being built, Italian workers arrived in Paris with their accordions. The ensuing war between Italian and Auvergnat musicians lasted thirty years, until a cele- brated cabrette player, Antonin Bouscatel, let his daughter marry the famous accordionist Charles Peguri. Peace was restored and from then on, Auvergnat and Italian migrants established in Paris played together, giving rise to a new, syncretic musette (literally “bagpipe) accordion style, which in the twentieth century came to typify the popular music first of Paris and later all of France.","Raymond Jabrier, accordion and voice",Male Voice; Accordion,Men,,Claudie Marcel-Dubois; Marguerite Pichonet-Andral,1952,Columbia Records,"Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: France.

By the end of the nineteenth century, briolée singing competitions were being held in Berry. Similar plowing songs have been found in various parts of France (Morvan, Nivernais, Dordogne, Poitou) and in the West Indies (Guadeloupe and Martinique); they also occur in other Mediterranean countries and in the Middle East (the horovel of Armenia, for instance). The performer on this historic 1913 wax cylinder recording, Henri Viaud, was born in Nohant in 1862, when George Sand was still alive (she died in 1876).

On the whole Americans have preferred ballads of ill-fated love, and Britons, ballads of illicit and erotic love. The popularity of “Lord Lovell” in America is in part due to its appearance in numerous songsters. In fact, the tune was often used for parodies and the ballad was frequently burlesqued around the time of the Civil War. Arthur K. Davis surmises that this tendency to make fun of the ballad might be due to the fact that its tune is a bit light for such a tragic theme.

Child has ten and Bronson, 74 variants of this song, including a transcription of Jeannie Robertson’s version.",Mrs. Ethel Findlater,Female Voice,Women,"Lord Lovel he stood at his castle gate,
A-combing his milk-white steed,
When down came her lady-love Nancy Bell
To wish her lover good speed.

“O where are you going, Lord Lovel?” she says,
“O where are you going?” says she.
“I’m going, my lady-love, Nancy Bell,
Strange countries for to see.” 

“When will you be back, Lord Lovel?” she says,
“When will you be back?” says she.
“A year or two, or three at the furthest,
I’ll be back to my Lady Nancy.”

He had not been twelve months and a day,
Strange countries for to see.
When the languishing thoughts came into his mind,
His Lady Nancy to go see. 

He rode and he rode on his milk-white steed,
Till he came to London town.
And there he heard the church-bells ringing,
And the people all mournin’ around.    

“O what is the matter?” Lord Lovel, he says,
“O what is the matter?” says he.
And a voice makes answer,
“A lady has died, and they call her Lady Nancy.” 

He ordered her grave to be opened wide,
And the shrouds to be thrown aside.
And there he kissed her clay cold lips,
Till the tears came tinklin’ down.   

Lady Nancy Bell died as today, 
Lord Lovel he died as to-morrow.
Lady Nancy Bell was laid in a cold churchyard,
Lord Lovel was laid in a shire.

Lady Nancy Bell was laid in a cold churchyard,
Lord Lovel was laid in a shire.
And out of her bosom grew a red, red rose, 
And out of her lovers a briar  (’gher).

They grew and they grew to the old church spire,
Where they could grow no higher.
And there they entwined in a true-lover’s knot, 
All true-lovers for to admire (’igher).",Peter Kennedy,1952,Caedmon Records,"The Folk Songs of Britain: Volume IV, The Child Ballads, I. Caedmon Records TC 1145, 1961","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

The moon was shining bright-e-ly, the stars were twinkling clear,
When he went to his love’s window to ease her of her pain, 
And she quick-e-ly rose and let him in and went to bed again.

My father and my mother in yonder room do lay,
They are embracing one another and so may you and I.
They are embracing one another without a fear or doubt,
Saying, “Take me in your arms, my love, and blow the candle out.”

My mother she’d be ang-e-ry if she should come to know,
My father he’d be angry too, to prove my overthrow. 
I wouldn’t forfeit five guineas now, that they should find me out,
Saying, “Take me in your arms, my love, and blow the candle out.”

[Additional verses: O when your baby it is born, you may dandle it on your knee,
And if it be a baby boy, then name it after me.
For when nine months are over, my apprenticeship is out,
I’ll return and do my duty and blow the candle out.]

Now six month were over, six months and a day,
He wrote his love a letter that he was going away.
He wrote his love a letter without a fear or doubt,
Saying he never should return again to blow the candle out.

Come, all you pretty young local girls, a warning take by me,
And don’t be quick to fall in love with everyone you see,
For when they’re in their ’prenticeship they'll swear their time is out,

This could actually be called an ""UN-broken token"" ballad,  because in this song, the ring is not broken, but is presented as a memento of the young woman's lost love. The text is very similar to another Napoleonic ballad, ""The Plains of Waterloo,"" except that there the young man reveals himself to be the young woman's long lost love, alive and well, presenting his half of the ring as proof, the more typical conclusion of a ""broken token"" story.",Marie Hare,Female Voice,Women,"As I walked out one evening in June,
To view the fine parks and the meadows in bloom,
I spied a young damsel, she appeared like a queen,
In her costly fine robes and her mantle so green.
I stood in amaze, I was caught by surprise,
I thought her an angel that fell from the skies,
Her eyes like the diamond, her cheeks like the rose,
She's one of the fairest that nature composed.

Says I ""Pretty fair maid would you come with me?
We'll join in wedlock and married we'll be.
I'll dress you in rich attire, the fair like a queen,
In her costly fine robes and her mantle so green.""
She said ""My young man, you must be excused,
For I'll wed no man and you must be refused.
The green fields I'll wander, the sun all in bloom,
For the lad I love best lies in famed Waterloo.

Since you will not marry, tell me your lover's name,
I have been in battle, I might know the same.""
""Draw near to my garment and there you will see
His letter embroidered in my mantle so green.""
In the ribbon of her mantle 'tis there I behold
his name and his surname in letters of gold,
Young William O'Reilly appeared in my view -
He was my chief comrade in famed Waterloo.
And as he was a-dying, I heard his last cry,
""For you lovely Nancy, I'm willing to die.
And that is the truth, and the truth I declare,
Here is a token, a gold ring I wear.""",Louise Manny,1959,Smithsonian Folkways,"Folk Songs of the Miramichi.

He was laid to rest in Boiestown's Roman Catholic graveyard and his grave is marked with a simple white cross with the sign, ""Peter Amberley, Died 1881"". A local farmer, John Calhoun, wrote the ballad to express the deep sorrow of the whole community about Peter's unexpected death. Mr. Calhoun's friends, Abraham Munn, set the ballad to a mixolydian modal tune. ""The poem itself is very reminiscent of other old songs. Mr. Calhoun employed many familiar phrases and even lifted a whole verse from the ""Queen Maries"" to adorn his composition. But this is the usual practice of ballad makers -- 'gold is where you find it - take it'!"".

3. Here's adieu unto my father,
It was him that drove me here.
I thought it very cruel of him,
His treatment was severe.

For it is not right to impress a boy,
Or try to keep him down,
For it oft times drives him from his home,
When he is far too young.

4. Here's adieu unto my greatest friend,
I mean my mother dear,
Who rearee a son that fell as quick
When he left her tender care.
It's little she thought not long ago,
When she sang a lullaby, 
What country I might ramble in,
Or what death that I might die.

5. Here's adieu unto Prince Edward's Isle,
And the isle along the shore, 
No more I'll walk its flowery banks,
Or enjoy a summer's breeze.

No more I'll watch those gallant brigs, 
As they go sailing by,
With their white sails sailing in the wind,
Far above their canvas high.

6. But it's now before I pass away,
There is one more thing I pray,
That some good heavenly father,
Will bless my mouldering grave.

Near by the city of Boiestown,
Where my mouldering bones do lay,
Awaiting for my Savior's call,
On that great Judgement Day. ",Louise Manny,1959,Smithsonian Folkways,"Folk Songs of the Miramichi.

Mrs. Grant Covey, the performer, knows the game since her childhood. She described it as the players needing to form up in couples and go around in a ring; girls and boys choosing each other and so on until they were all taken. (Helen Creighton, Folk Music From Nova Scotia, Folkways Records, Album No. FM 4006, 1956)",Mrs. Grant Covey,Female Voice,Women,"Rain rain the wind does blow,
Stars are shining to and fro,
Marie Richardson says she'll die
If she don't get a fellow with a rolling eye.

She is handsome, she is pretty,
She is a girl from the Halifax city,
She has lovers one two three 
Please and tell us who they be.

Gordie Isnor says he'll have her,
All the boys are fighting for her,

2668,44.58,-63.45,,,22826,,0:04:00,6B5.A4,Captain Conrod,Comic Song,"Comic song, poking fun at a Halifax firm Starr and Captain Conrod 

When songs are composed locally the custom is to
take a well known tune and make up words to fit it.
Local songs tend to be very Gloomy or very gay. The
sad ones tell of wrecks at sea and disasters in the
mines or lumber woods. The gay ones usually poke fun
at some locality or individual, and the subject of
the song is never spared by any consideration of his
feelinc;s. Starr was the name of a Halifax firm, and
Captain Conrod was a Halifax man. The sone is sung
by Edmund Henneberry of Devil's Island. ",Edmund Henneberry,Male Voice,Men,"Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,
Bring your ship to an anchor and listen to me,
Three weeks in the hollows I lay drunk on the shore,
Like some frolicksome youth I have wasted my store.

Chorus:

And sing fal the diddle earal, diddle earal I dey.

Some frolicksome youth put an end to my fun,
My friends were darn scarce when my money's all gone,
I drawed my advance for to finish the ball
And to drink with my friends like a good-hearted soul.

Chorus.

I put my bag on my back and down I did wag
With a bottle of brandy so snug in my bag,
In a brig called the Mary belonging to Starr
I went down blazing drunk like a jolly Jack Tar.

Chorus.

Was on Monday morning we gave her full sail,
The wind from the northwest did blow a sweet gale,
My heart with the horrors did beat pitty pat,
And a tear in my eye like a ferry-house rat.

Chorus.

When eight bells did struck I went down for to steer,
All sorts of strange voices they rang in my ear,
With whispering all by me I dare not look round,
And there I stood trembling while the cold sweat run down. 

Chorus.

Says I, ""I'll go down get a wee sup of grog,""
My head then was going nine knots by the log,
But when I got there just as sure as you're born,
Not a sup in the bottle, not one blessed horn.

Chorus.

The mate like myself being a darn drunken beast,
While I was ashore on my brandy did feast,
But when I got there just as sure as you're born
He never left a sup in the bottle, not one blessed horn.

Chorus.

Oh now we are ploughing all on the rough sea,
The horrors are over, thank God we are free,
And since I am here and got nothing to do
I'll sing of our captain just one verse or two.

Chorus.

Our captain an old Methodist preacher had been,
One of the stingiest old beggars that ever was seen,
Salt cod and religion he gave us to eat
And then once a week just a small chunk of meat.

Chorus.

When twelve o'clock comes he goes down for to eat,
Like a hard-dying angel he stretched out his feet,
He turned up his eyes to the blessings of God
With a plate of boiled rice and a junk of salt cod.

Chorus.

When he is tired of reading his book
He goes down forward and fights with the cook,
He walks on the quarter-deck smoking his pipe
With his face griddled up like an old piece of tripe.

Chorus.

Now our voyage is over, our voyage is up,
In Halifax Harbour we'll coil up our ropes,
We'll let go both anchors with moor stem and stern,
With a plentiful table we'll spin then the yarn.

Chorus.

All things shall be ready, all things shall be right,
There'll be roast beef and mutton to eat day and night,
There'll be no short allowance on rusty salt cod,
So to hell with Starr's Mary and Captain Conrod.

Sung: I’ve had a sweetheart these three days, / if the Lord wills, I’ll be her truelove. // I got a letter that we are called up to war, / my dear truelove couldn’t stop crying. // “Don’t cry so, for I’m still here, / when the war is over, we’ll be back.” // The war is over, her truelove returns, / he goes and knocks on his sweetheart’s door. // “Who is knocking on my door at this hour of the night? / My candle has gone out and I don’t dare open it.”",Laura Boulton,1941,Smithsonian Folkways,"Songs of French Canada.

Moreover, she grew up surrounded by a large, musically endowed community. It is a testament to Hall’s talent and character that, of all the African American singers recorded by the Lomax family, Alan Lomax featured her in The Rainbow Sign, which documents her life history. Using the pseudonym Nora  to present her oral history, Lomax described her vocal skill: “It is a liquid, full contralto, rich in low overtones; but it can leap directly into falsetto and play there as effortlessly as a bird in the wind.”

It is right and proper that this recording opens with “Another Man Done Gone.” The Lomaxes (father and son) selected it among their Best Loved American Folk Songs.  Located in the “work song” chapter of their Folk Songs of North America, this tune provides a furtive look at race relations in the South and the harsh reality of its penal system. The song also examines the subversive side of African American life. As Alan Lomax later indicated, “African Americans in the Deep South do not gossip freely with white men about such matters.” It speaks volumes about the Lomaxes (husband and wife) that Hall elected to sing it before them.",Vera Hall,Female Voice,Women,"Another man done gone.

And charmed the heart of a lady, 
Charmed the heart of a lady. 

Says, Little Miss, will you go with me? 
He says, Will you be my honey? 
I swear by the sword that hangs by my side
You 'll never want for money, 
You'll never want for money. 

The old man came in late that night, 
Inquiring for is lady 
The servants thought(?) before he thought, 
She's gone with Black Jack Davy, 
She's gone with Black Jack Davy. 

Go saddle me up my milk white horse, 
Go saddle him slow and easy, 
I'll ride all night 'til broad daylight 
And overtake my lady, 
Overtake my lady. 

He rode all night 'til the broad day light , 
'Til he came to the edge of the water, 
There he looked on the other side, 
And there he spied his darling, 
There he spied his darling.

Will you forsake your baby? 
Will you for sake the one you love 
To go with Black Jack Davy?

Yes, I'll forsake my house and home, 
Yes, I'll forsake my baby, Yes, I'll forsake the one I love 
To go with Black Jack Davy, 
To go with Black Jack Davy. 

Then, pull off that little black glove you wear, 
Made out of Spanish leather. 
Place your little white hand in mine, 
And here we'll part forever, 
Here we'll part forever. 

She pulled off that little black glove she wore, 
Made out of Spanish leather, 
Placed her little white hand in his, 
And there they parted forever, 
There they parted forever.

In some versions, a sweetheart appears in place of the sister, adding a new element of intrigue and a possible source of motivation to the plot.

Better known as Dock Boggs, he was a coal miner all his working life and, in his early years, spent his spare time entertaining the mining communities of the southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky border where he lived. His emotional banjo playing and stark vocals made haunting music that reflected the economic circumstances of both the black and white miners whose musical traditions he encountered and absorbed. It is the melancholy engendered by listening to his music that proved his greatest appeal, a mood that is infused with the blues of his black mining neighbors. Based on the “Darling Corey” theme, “Country Blues” comes from the tradition of white blues ballads that developed alongside their black counterparts during the final years of the nineteenth century. The music of Boggs and his ilk became familiar to Alan Lomax during the late 1930s when he began studying the catalogues of commercial phonograph companies, looking for parallels to the music that he and his father were collecting in the field.

Saw a crowd gathered at the creek at a little country farm
I thought that I'd go closer so I might see and hear
Why they looked so happy there without a thing to fear

Was a good old country baptizing I was at that day
They'd preach awhile and sing awhile then they'd all kneel down and pray
God's spirit seemed to fill the air and every soul was meek
At a good old country baptizing down at the creek

I heard an old and gentle voice sing right in the end
We're so glad to have you here welcome down my friend
We've had a big revival sir down to it all week

Now we're having a baptizing down at the creek

Was a good old country baptizing I was at that day
They'd preach awhile and sing awhile then they'd all kneel down and pray
God's spirit seemed to fill the air and every soul was meek
At a good old country baptizing down at the creek

Well among them happy be among that happy throne
See them all go air their sins while they're at their own
They seem to be saying with a smile upon their face
I'm ready now to move along to my resting place

Won't you go and give them, sister, read them all over to me

Read those precious lines so clearly that I won't be see them one
For the precious hand that penned them, his life's work for me is done
When I'm dead and in my coffin, and my shroud around me is bound
And my little bed is ready in the cold and silent ground
Take his picture and his locket place together over to my heart
And the little ring he gave me from my finger never part

There you've read them all there sister, won't you read them all again
While I listen to you read them, I'll lose all sense of them
While I listen to you read them, I will gently fall asleep
Fall asleep to wake with Jesus, oh dear sister do not weep

The Lomaxes and others recorded numerous versions of this archetypal Mississippi prison song. “Rosie” was a generic name for a woman at Parchman Farm Penitentiary, and turns up in other prison songs recorded there. Nina Simone used the melody of “Rosie” for her 1965 recording of “Be My Husband”. A version by Leadbelly was adapted with new words by The Animals and retitled “Inside Looking Out.” It appeared as the B-side to The Animals’ eighth single, the first for Decca in 1966, and was produced by Tom Wilson after the band’s split from Mickie Most and EMI. Grand Funk Railroad also has had many versions of “Inside Looking Out” appear on both studio and live albums (Live Album (1970), Caught In The Act (1975), Live: The 1971 Tour).

While John A. continued to mine the rich vein of prison song, Alan, working independently, recorded in the free world until he returned to Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Penitentiary in 1948. He brought with him a tape recorder, a brand new technology at the time. He felt that the prison work song tradition was in decline but was pleased to find some singers like Tangle Eye who still carried it on. The song heard here is a “holler” on the theme of prison life and longing for freedom. Songs like this were used to accompany solitary agricultural labor, such as plowing, and could also be heard outside the prisons. With the addition of an instrument, such as a guitar, they formed the bulk of the vocal raw material of the blues. Similar hollers were sung in Africa and other African-American societies for other solitary tasks such as herding cattle.

Airy, North Carolina, where a man named Peter de Graff was convicted of murdering his sweetheart Ellen Smith, and was said to have composed this song in prison while awaiting his execution. Frank C. Brown, in his collection North Carolina Folklore, reports a version twelve stanzas long, dating from 1911. A. K. Davis lists six texts in Traditional Ballads of Virginia. Henry Whitter made a commercial record of the song in the late 1920s, and Molly O’Day recorded it with five-string banjo for Columbia in the late 1940s. The Country Gentlemen made a hot bluegrass arrangement of it in 1960; it is still a standard in the bluegrass repertoire today.","Estil C. Ball, guitar",Guitar,Men,"Poor Ellen Smith, how she was found,
Shot through her heart, lying cold on the ground.

The smoke begin to fly, the blood begin to run.
They shot my poor sweetheart with a forty-four gun.

I saw her on Monday before that sad day.
They found her poor body and took it away.

Who had the heart, who had the face,
To murder my sweetheart in this lonesome place?

I laid out six months and prayed all the time,
They might find the one that committed the crime.

No one could go back and my character save;
The flowers had faded on poor Ellen’s grave.

So now I’m in jail and, God knows, it’s hard,
While sweetheart sleeps down in the lonesome graveyard.

Now I’m in jail, a prisoner am I,
But God is here with me and hears every vow.

I didn’t love little Ellen to make her my wife,
But I loved her too dear as to take her sweet life.

Oh, the jury will hang me, that is, if they can,
But God knows I’ll die as an innocent man.",Alan Lomax; Shirley Collins,1959,Prestige Records,"Southern Journey Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress"

O death in the morning
O death in the morning
Spare me over for another year

Well, death walked up to the sinner's gate
I believe you have waited now a little too late
Your fever now is one hundred and two
Have a narrow chance that you'll ever pull through

O death
Crying o death in the morning
O death in the morning
Death spare me over for another year

O what is this I see?
Cold icy hands all over me
You Say I am death no one can excel
I open the doors of death and Hell

You cried O death
Now o death in the morning
O death in the morning
Death spare me over for another year

Know you here got people
Sing and pray you would not hear
You just walked away
You would not even bend your knee
Now you got to come and go with me

O death
O death in the morning
O death in the morning
Spare me over for another year

Well now gonna fix your feet where you can't walk
Fix your tongue so you cannot talk
Close your eyes an' you cannot see
You got to come now an' go with me

O death
Now o death in the morning
O death in the morning
Death Spare me over for another year

Well death, consider my age
And do not take me in this stage
Because all of my wealth is at your command
If you just remove your cold icy hand

You cried, o no
Now o death in the morning
No no
Lord spare me over for another year

O mother standing by the bed
With an aching heart
And a hung down head
And the doctor looked 'round very sad
Said you're the worst ever case I ever had

O death
O death in the morning
O death in the morning
Death Spare me over for another year

He said mother I got feet and I can't walk
I got a tongue mother and I can't talk
I got eyes and I can't see
Nothin' but death has got the shackles on me

Now o death
O death in the morning
O death in the morning
O death Spare me over for another year

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

Titanic left Southampton
With all their sport and game
But when they struck that iceberg
I know their mind was changed

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

Their mothers told their daughters
On a pleasure trip they may go
But when they struck that iceberg
They haven't been seen anymore

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

One man, John Jacob Astor
Was a man with pluck and brain
While this great ship was sinkin'
All the women he tried to save

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

He was warended by a freight boat
Captain Smith would not take heed
But instead of givin' a warnin'
He ran with greater speed

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

He kissed his wife a last time
When the boiler did explode
He helped her in the lifeboat
Sayin' ""I won't see you anymo""

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

The story of the shipwreck
Is almost too sad to tell
One thousand and six hundred
Went down forever to dwell

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

Well, the fourteenth day of April
It was in nineteen hundred and twelve
The ship had a wreck by the iceberg
It went down forever to dwell

God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
God moves on the waters, April the fourteen day
Everybody had to run and pray

Kathaka≥i is rooted in the temple genre of Kerala known as K¨†iyå††am, India’s only surviving traditional Sanskrit theater form, whose history goes back over 1500 years. In reaction to disturbances caused by the Portuguese occupation of the Kerala coast, a bhakti (Hindu devotional) movement arose in sixteenth century Kerala. This in turn gave rise to the creation of vernacular literary texts, including several plays written in south Kerala in the late sixteenth century based on religious stories from the Råmåyaˆa epic. This form, known as Råmanå††am (“Råma drama”), gradually evolved and was renamed Kathaka¬i (“story play”) in the 18th century, when new plays were written and performed based on the Mahåbhårata epic. The author of these plays was a prince of north Kerala who greatly expanded the depth of expression (bhåva) and characterization, developed the use of numerous rågas and tålas for their emotional impact, and enhanced the costuming, makeup and staging. Today’s highly sophisticated and virtuosic Kathaka¬i is performed by male musicians and actors whose lives are dedicated to perfecting their art.

This extract presents the mythological king DakΩa, the embodiment of creative power, competence, and intelligence born of Brahma himself. He is said to have had a vast number of daughters, including Sati, who eventually committed suicide because of a disagreement between her father and her husband, Íiva. In this kathaka¬i play, the playwright offers a psychological explanation for the family tensions that led to Sati’s suicide by fire; her father’s contempt and derision because of her devotion to Lord Íiva.

In this extract, the four percussionists first play a prelude in six beats, which serves as entrance music for the actor. The lead singer then sings DakΩa’s lines, accusing Sati of sin and impurity, and expelling her from his sacrificial hall. His lines are aggressively set to the bold contours of a pentatonic råga called Såra∫ga, which does not resemble the Såra∫ga of either North or South Indian classical music but uses the following five notes and is similar to the South Indian råga Mohanam:
                        
C   D   E   G   A   c

 This is performed in a medium-tempo seven beat cycle called Tripu†a:
Claps:                     X              O
                1    2    3    4    5    6    7
Drum syllables:     ta   ki   †a   ta   ka   di   mi

The actor meanwhile mimes the text. The first line is repeated to allow the actor to execute variations in his facial expressions and gestures. The percussionists then play an interlude for the actor to execute additional movements. Then two half-lines are sung, after each of which one or two accompanying voice(s) join in repetitions, concluding with the repetition of the opening line. The percussionists intervene with a second interlude, until the voice for the female character Sati mournfully emerges, accompanied in muted strokes in a slow seven-beat cycle. She warns her father that his opposition to Lord Shiva, to whom she is devoted, will bring on his wrath. Sati’s pathetic plea is aptly set to Punnagavarå¬¥ råga with its languorous ornaments and minor intervals:

                        C    Db    Eb    F    G    Ab    Bb    c

The third degree (E) is, however, extremely low and actually sounds only a half step above the lowered second degree, as in some South Indian classical rågas. Each line is repeated except the final fourth line, which is interrupted by a percussion interlude heralding DakΩa’s furious response in rapid seven-beat cycles of Muri a†aˆ†a tå¬a (similar to Tripu†a tåla, but faster), set to Kedåragau¬a råga with its pentatonic ascent and heptatonic descent:

        C    D    F    G    Bb    c              c    Bb    A    G    F    E    D    C

After he repeats two lines threatening to call his slaves to oust Sati, the percussionists accelerate the tempo for his climactic dance of rage.",Orchestra of the dancer Gopinath,Orchestra,,,Alain Daniélou,1952,Columbia Records,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.

The style of performance suggests that it may be a form of Tamil ritual theater called Teruk ̈ttu (“street play”) also recently named “Ka†aik ̈ttu” (“story play”) since it is not played in a street, but in front of a temple. If so, however, it is not performed by a professional troupe which always uses a mukha v¥ˆå, a short, double - reed pipe along with other instruments. It is not uncommon for a particular style of Indian drama to be performed by communities of specialist performers who in the caste system have another hereditary occupation. For instance, the Vaˆˆå ̃ community of washermen who are one of the professional performing groups of Teruk ̈ttu. Danielou writes that the two songs given here are part of a drama composed and performed by fishermen in their own village. The first of these invokes the Dravidian goddess M¥nåk≈≈Ω¥, the daughter of the demon Kuvera.

The song is sung in the South Indian To∂¥ scale with four flats:
C Db Eb F G Ab Bb c

However, it is not exactly like the present - day South Indian classical råga To∂¥ in which very flat, widely oscillating third and sixth degrees are used. 
A second theme in double speed extends beyond the octave and establishes the upper tetrachord.

In his original notes, Danielou gives the background of the Ah¥r community as follows: “When the Aryans invaded India many centuries before Christ, the defeated people were allotted certain professions and thus were allowed to survive, maintaining their culture and religion to a great extent. The ancient and proud Abh¥r¢as, now called Ah¥rs, have thus been milkmen and cowherds for centuries and have kept alive forms of songs, dance, and epic poetry similar to those of many centuries ago.” Danielou was very attracted to the music of the Ah¥rs and produced an LP of their music in 1951 that was republished in 1984. 

The term virahå or birahå is now given to a broad classification of songs, while this form of virahå is more precisely known as kha®¥ birahå. This is a special style of song developed by the Ah¥r cowherders ostensibly to communicate with other herders and their distant villages while pasturing their animals. 

The antiquity of the Ah¥r community is corroborated by the fact that they are referred to (as ÅAbh¥ra cowherds) in the Råmåyaˆa and the Mahåbhårata epics dating from several centuries B.C.E. There is no way to establish the contention that they are pre-Aryans, especially as the texts of their kha®¥ birahås usually refer, as in this case, to the Aryan epic, Råmåyaˆa. Other references in their songs are evidently to their own myths, which could predate the Aryan invasions.","Nanku, Bachau, nagara ","Nanku; Bachau, Nagara",Unknown,"Danielou’s translation of the song text follows:

Chanted:
Aré! It is said—The horse named Mangaru was born in Maurapura City of king Alivå. O Father! But the Ahir was born in the bazar of Gaur¢a. 
Aré! It is said—[The girl] Chanavå was born in the great [city of] Kusumipura.
Lament:
Aré! Lourikå [the hero] kept her, O Mother! In the vast bazaar of Haradiyå.
Chanted:
Aré! It is said—Climbing to capture the city of Lankå [Ceylon] the brothers fought their way heroes among
heroes.*
Aré! It is said—Taking bow and arrows, Råm¢a went up.
Lament:
Aré! Now holding his club in the battle goes up the great hero (the monkey Hanumån¢a).
Chanted:
Aré! It is said—The river Ganges, O Mother! Would not come up. The (river) Bhagirathi went to fetch her. No one could remain. All families fled (before the flood).
Lament:
Now all have dispersed in the world in exile. With their children and women.
Chanted:
Aré! It is said—It has been seen, the misfortune of the great Gaur¢a city has been written, but who has the courage to relate the destiny of Chanavå.
Aré! The destiny of Lourikå and the destruction of the great city of Naurapur¢a.
Lament:
Dådu was the virtuous brother of Lourikå. O Mother! But all the great misfortunes fell upon his head.
Chanted:
Aré! It is said—The She-buffalo suffered in the forest. The great She-buffalo (*) did not receive her income from trade.
Aré! It is said—There was no stock of dried straw. Great poverty in the home. And disputes always spread where there are debts.

Composed by Munni Lål. Recorded in Benares. Kajar¥, also called kajl¥, is a seasonal song of Uttar Pradesh sung in Bhojpuri (a dialect of Hindi) that is usually associated with the monsoon rains, the most erotic of seasons. Kajl¥ texts often deal with the separation of lovers symbolized by Krishna and his favorite milkmaid, Rådhå. In this text, the couple engage in a favorite monsoon love-sport beneath Krishna’s most cherished tree, the fragrant kadamba.","Kedarnath, chorus of Sitaram Raja, Jattu, Kalka Prasad, dholak, Motilal, jhori","Male Voices; Dholak; Motilal, Jhori",Men,"The text as summarized by Danielou is given as follows:

The swing hangs from the branch of the Kadamba tree,
Krishn¢a and Rådhå, his beloved, swing, swing.
The rope is of green silk and the boy is dressed in green.
Her sari is purple and in her green palanquin
Among all her maids her beauty cannot be described.
Green green is the milkman’s boy 
And green the branch of the Kadamba tree.
How seductive is Krishn¢a, he steals our hearts,
And our minds dissolve in him ...

The musical structure is that of a leader with a chorus that repeats the whole or part of the leader’s verse. Melodically, the song has two themes, with the second part being pitched higher than the first, somewhat like the sthåy¥-antrå form of classical music. The second theme has a range of a sixth and does not reach the upper octave as in the antrå:

Groups of wandering mendicants who travel from one shrine to another singing devotional songs (bhajans) are found to this day. This is rather an unusual ensemble of wandering ascetics, principally because the stringed instrument identified in the title as an ekatårå, a drone instrument, actually appears to be a fretted sitar, as can be heard on the record and seen in the photograph. A sitår with its many strings is normally much too delicate an instrument to be carted around from village to village, especially in the heat of Rajasthan, while a spiked lute ektår¢a that plays only a drone is much more usual. The musicians are probably not monks, but novices training to become ordained at some shrine or and other where they generally will return once a year.","Mahadeva giri, Munna giri, group of companions, chang, ekatara, karatala",Male Voices; Chang; Ekatara; Karatala,Men,"The following translation is by Danielou:

In his hair the Ganges plays,
And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess* caresses him.

Holding in his hand the garland of skulls,
Day and night he drinks the cup of poison [hashish],
His drum roaring “dama, dama”

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Wearing at his waist the skin of a beast,
A scorpion tied as an armlet,
This merciless youth spends his life,

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Singing the virtues of the Teacher
And counting hardships
Shall be your daily consolation,
Meditating on the Mountain’s Goddess,

And seated on his lap,
The White Goddess caresses him.

The Bauls belong to a syncretic mystic cult of wandering mendicants in Bengal and Bangladesh. Their ideas are influenced by Vaishnava Hinduism and Sufi Islam as well as by Tantric Buddhism. Perhaps because of their unconventional beliefs, the word baul is said to mean “one who is crazy.” There are many cults of wandering musicians in India, all with their own philosophical and mystical underpinnings that are reflected in their unique lifestyles, clothing, songs and even the instruments they use. Bauls frequently travel alone and although accompaniment on the dotåra (lit. “two - stringed” but often having four strings, as in this instance) is not unusual, they more often accompany themselves on khamak (a variable - tension chordophone that may often described as a plucked drum) or ektårå (monochord) and simultaneously play a small drum (∂ugg¥) as they sing and dance. In recent times they have achieved international recognition, and Baul performers have toured widely, and their ensembles now often include instruments such as the harmonium and khol (double conical drum) as well as small cym bals and clappers.","Haripada Devanath, accompanying himself on dotar",Male Voice; Dotar,Men,"The translation of the Baul song as given by Danielou is as follows:

The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide 
his own craft.
Unaware of the current
You start the voyage to the other shore.

Taking the wealth you received from the Great Lord, you 
started your trip on the ocean of lust.

The words of Eros murmured by the striking waves 
will break your craft 
and nothing will be left.

The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.
Make the door of prayer the way to salvation.
Hold your boat with the divine name
Do not try for the shore which lust suggests
And you will fear no storm or tempest.

The mind’s helsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.

But the mad helmsman is not ready [to hear].
It starts across in the storm and wind
Where wait for him the six enemy boatmen [lust, anger, greed illusion, envy, and vanity].

The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.",Alain Daniélou,1953,Columbia Records,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.

Although Muslim invaders did bring new musical ideas and concepts from Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere in the Middle East, Qawwål¥ is a purely South Asian construct and has no parallel elsewhere. The word is said to be derived from the Arabic “Qaul”, meaning “dictum” or “saying,” but the genre has evolved a great deal from that concept. In its traditional context, qawwål¥ refers to Muslim religious, devotional, and mystical songs in praise of Allah, the Prophet, his descendants, and Muslim saints. The genre has extended to include, in the first place, ghazals — mystical love songs using the analogy of human love — and also a variety of other subjects, including Hindu religious themes. The traditional languages of qawwål¥ are Persian, Arabic, and Urdu, but many others are also used, including Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, and Sindhi. 

Qawwål¥ s are not laments, but are songs of love and devotion sung in ecstatic style. This qawwål¥ is somewhat unusual as it is an exhortation to a lay person to say his prayers. It uses Husain’s martyrdom during prayer as an example of the depth of concentration that the person praying should attempt to attain. Although it is about Husain’ s martyrdom, this would not be sung during Muharram, when only an elegy, mar≈siya (or a stanza of which, called soz) is sung, using only vocal drones and no instruments. This qawwål¥ would be sung in mehfil (gatherings) particularly at shrines.","Muhammad Usman, Raza, Saukat Ali, with Rahamat Ullah, dholak, Raza, small Indian harmonium","Male Voices; Dholak; Raza, Small Indian Harmonium",Men,"The text and translation of this qawwål¥ follows:

Translation:

[Husain’s martyrdom]
If you seek to see [the light] then bow your head in prayer
If your heart experienced the light then you felt the ecstasy of prayer
Distance your heart from egotism put yourself into prayer
Then you will see the light of God in prayer
But first, like Husain [be prepared to] have your head cut off in prayer
The darling of ‘Ali [ i.e., Husain] never left his prayer
The terrible dagger was drawn but he kept on praying
Look at his prayer who will pray like that?
That is how the devout should pray as Husain prays
Once his head bowed in prayer it did not rise up from the prayer
Having called him as a guest [Shimr] honored his guest a great deal!
Though the river flowed nearby there was not a drop to drink
See the tyranny of this man He twirled his knife against Husain’s neck
Like Shimr in this world There was no one more stone - hearted
than he who cut Husain’s head cut while he was in prayer",Alain Daniélou,1953,Columbia Records,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.
